A penetrating, page-turning tour of a post-human Earth

IN THE WORLD WITHOUT US,
Alan Weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity’s impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our Earth without us.
In this far-reaching narrative, Weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic, bronze sculpture, radio waves, and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe.

The World Without Us reveals how, just days after humans disappear, floods in New York’s subways would start eroding the city’s foundations, and how, as the world’s cities crumble, asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. It describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild, how billions more birds would flourish, and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. Drawing on the expertise of engineers, atmospheric scientists, art conservators, zoologists, oil refiners, marine biologists, astrophysicists, religious leaders from rabbis to the Dalai Lama, and paleontologists—who describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammoths—Weisman illustrates what the planet might be like today, if not for us.
From places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval European forest; the Korean DMZ; Chernobyl), Weisman reveals Earth’s tremendous capacity for self-healing.

_(continued from front flap)_

As he shows which human devastations are indelible, and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest, Weisman’s narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn’t depend on our demise. It is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch, it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has.

CHAPTER 7

What Falls Apart

N THE SUMMER of 1976, Allan Cavinder got a call he wasn’t expecting. The Constantia Hotel in Varosha was reopening under a new name after standing vacant for nearly two years. A lot of electrical work was needed—was he available?

This was a surprise. Varosha, a resort on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, had been off-limits to everyone since war fractured the country two years earlier. The actual fighting had lasted only a month before the United Nations stepped in to broker a messy truce between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. A no-man’s zone called the Green Line was drawn wherever opposing troops found themselves at the exact moment of the cease-fire. In the capital, Nicosia, the Green Line wandered like a drunk among bullet-scarred avenues and houses. On narrow streets where hand-to-hand combat had been underway between enemies jabbing bayonets from facing balconies, it was little more than 10 feet wide. In the country, it broadened to five miles. Turks now lived to the north and Greeks to the south of a weedy UN-patrolled strip, refuge to hares and partridges.

When the war broke out in 1974, much of Varosha was barely two years old. Strung along a sand crescent south of the deep-water port of Famagusta, a walled city dating to 2000 BC, Varosha had been developed by Greek Cypriots as Cyprus’s Riviera. By 1972, tall hotels extended three uninterrupted miles along Varosha’s golden beach, backed by blocks of shops, restaurants, cinemas, vacation bungalows, and employee housing.

The location had been chosen for the gentle, warm waters on the island’s wind-sheltered eastern coast. The sole flaw was the decision, repeated by nearly every beachfront high-rise, to build as close to shore as possible. Too late, they realized that once the sun peaked at noon, the beach would lie in a shadow cast by the palisade of hotels.

There wasn’t much time to worry about that, though. In the summer of 1974, war flared, and when it halted a month later, Varosha’s Greek Cypriots saw their grand investment end up on the Turkish side of the Green Line. They and all Varosha’s residents had to flee south, to the Greek side of the island.

About the size of Connecticut, mountainous Cyprus floats in a placid aquamarine sea ringed by several countries whose genetically intertwined peoples often detest each other. Ethnic Greeks arrived on Cyprus some 4,000 years ago, and subsequently lived under a parade of conquering Assyrians, Phoenicians, Persians, Romans, Arabs, Byzantines, English crusaders, French, and Venetians. The year 1570 brought yet another conqueror, the Ottoman Empire. With it came Turkish settlers, who by the 20th century would comprise slightly less than one-fifth of the island’s population.

After World War I finished off the Ottomans, Cyprus ended up as a British colony. The island’s Greeks, Orthodox Christians who had periodically revolted against the Ottoman Turks, weren’t thrilled to have British rulers instead, and clamored for unification with Greece. The Turkish Cypriot Muslim minority protested. Tensions boiled for decades and erupted viciously several times during the 1950s. A 1960 compromise resulted in the independent Republic of Cyprus, with power shared between Greeks and Turks.

Ethnic hatred, however, had by then become a habit: Greeks massacred entire Turkish families, and Turks ferociously avenged them. A military takeover in Greece detonated a coup on the island, midwifed by the American CIA in honor of Greece’s new anticommunist rulers. That prompted Turkey in July 1974 to send troops to protect Turkish Cypriots from being annexed by Greece. During the ensuing brief war, each side was accused of inflicting atrocities on the other’s civilians. When the Greeks placed anti-aircraft guns atop a high-rise in the seaside resort of

Varosha, Turkish bombers attacked in American-made jets, and Varosha’s
Greeks ran for their lives.

Allan Cavinder, a British electrical engineer, had arrived on the island two
years earlier, in 1972. He had been taking assignments with a London firm
throughout the Middle East, and when he saw Cyprus, he decided to stay.
Except for torrid July and August, the island’s weather was mostly mild
and spotless. He settled on the northern shore, below mountains where
yellow limestone villages lived off the harvests of olive and carob trees,
which they exported from an inlet harbor at his town, Kyrenia.
When the war began, he decided to wait it out, figuring correctly that
there would be demand for his expertise when it ended. He wouldn’t have
predicted the call from the hotel, however. After the Greeks abandoned
Varosha, the Turkish Cypriots, rather than let squatters colonize it, decided that the fancy resort would be more valuable as a bargaining chip
when negotiations for a permanent reconciliation got underway. So they
built a chain-link fence around it, strung barbed wire across the beach, stationed Turkish soldiers to guard it, and posted signs warning everyone else
away.
After two years, however, an old Ottoman foundation that owned
property that included the northernmost Varosha hotel requested permission to refurbish and reopen it. It was a sensible idea, Cavinder could see.
The four-story hotel, to be renamed the Palm Beach, sat far enough back
on a shoreline bend that its terrace and beachfront remained sunny
through the afternoon. The hotel tower next-door, which had briefly held
a Greek machine-gun placement, had collapsed during the Turkish bombing raid, but aside from its rubble everything else Allan Cavinder found
when he first entered the zone seemed intact.
Early so: he was struck by how quickly humans had abandoned it.
The hotel registry was still open to August 1974, when business had suddenly halted. Room keys lay where they’d been tossed on the front desk.
Windows facing the sea had been left open, and blowing sand had formed
small dunes in the lobby. Flowers had dried in vases; Turkish coffee demi-
tasses and breakfast dishes licked clean by mice were still in place on the
table linens.
His task was to bring the air-conditioning system back into service.

Abandoned hotel, Varosha, Cyprus.

However, this routine job was proving difficult. The southern, Greek portion of the island had UN recognition as the legitimate Cyprus government, but a separate Turkish state in the north was recognized only by Turkey. With no access to spare parts, an arrangement was made with Turkish troops guarding Varosha to allow Cavinder to quietly cannibalize whatever he needed from the other vacant hotels.

He wandered through the deserted town. About 20,000 people had lived or worked in Varosha. Asphalt and pavement had cracked; he wasn’t surprised to see weeds growing in the deserted streets, but hadn’t expected to see trees already. Australian wattles, a fast-growing acacia species used by hotels for landscaping, were popping out midstreet, some nearly three feet high. Creepers from ornamental succulents snaked out of hotel gardens, crossing roads and climbing tree trunks. Shops still displayed souvenirs and tanning lotion; a Toyota dealership was showing

1974 Corollas and Celicas. Concussions from Turkish air force bombs, Cavinder saw, had exploded plate-glass store windows. Boutique man- nequins were half-clothed, their imported fabrics flapping in tattered strips, the dress racks behind them full but deeply dust coated. The canvas of baby prams was likewise torn—he hadn’t expected to see so many left behind. And bicycles.

The honeycombed facades of empty hotels, 10 stories of shattered sliding glass doors opening to seaview balconies now exposed to the ele- ments, had become giant pigeon roosts. Pigeon droppings coated every- thing. Carob rats nested in hotel rooms, living off Yaffa oranges and lemons from former citrus groves that had been absorbed into Varosha’s landscaping. The bell towers of Greek churches were spattered with the blood and feces of hanging bats.

Sheets of sand blew across avenues and covered floors. What surprised him at first was the general absence of smell, except for a mysterious stench that emanated from hotel swimming pools, most of which were in- explicably drained yet reeked as though filled with cadavers. Around them, the upturned tables and chairs, torn beach umbrellas, and glasses knocked on their sides all spoke of some revelry gone terribly wrong. Cleaning all this up was going to be expensive.

For six months, as he dismantled and rescued air conditioners, indus- trial washers and dryers, and entire kitchens full of ovens, grills, refrigera- tors, and freezers, silence pounded at him. It actually hurt his ears, he told his wife. During the year before the war, he’d worked at a British naval base south of town, and would often leave her at a hotel to enjoy a day at the beach. When he picked her up afterward, a dance band would be play- ing for the German and British tourists. Now, no bands, just the incessant kneading of the sea that no longer soothed. The wind sighing through open windows became a whine. The cooing of pigeons grew deafening. The sheer absence of human voices bouncing off walls was unnerving. He kept listening for Turkish soldiers, who were under instructions to shoot looters. He wasn’t certain how many assigned to patrol knew that he was there legally, or would give him a chance to prove it.

It turned out not to be a problem. He seldom saw any guards. He un- derstood why they would avoid entering such a tomb.

By the time Metin Münir saw Varosha, four years after Allan Cavinder’s
reclamation job ended, roofs had collapsed and trees were growing straight
out of houses. Münir, one of Turkey’s best-known newspaper columnists,
is a Turkish Cypriot who went to Istanbul to study, came home to fight
when the troubles began, then returned to Turkey when the troubles kept
going on, and on. In 1980, he was the first journalist allowed to enter
Varosha for a few hours.

The first thing he noticed was shredded laundry still hanging from

clotheslines. What struck him most, though, wasn’t the absence of life but
its vibrant presence. With the humans who built Varosha gone, nature was
intently recouping it. Varosha, merely 60 miles from Syria and Lebanon, is
too balmy for a freeze-thaw cycle, but its pavement was tossed asunder
anyway. The wrecking crews weren’t just trees, Münir marveled, but also
flowers. Tiny seeds of wild Cyprus cyclamen had wedged into cracks, germinated, and heaved aside entire slabs of cement. Streets now rippled with
white cyclamen combs and their pretty, variegated leaves.

“You understand,” Münir wrote his readers back in Turkey, “just what

the Taoists mean when say they say that soft is stronger than hard.”

Two more decades passed. The millennium turned, and kept going.

Once, Turkish Cypriots had bet that Varosha, too valuable to lose, would
force the Greeks to the bargaining table. Neither side had dreamed that, 30plus years later, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus would still exist,
severed not only from the Greek Republic of Cyprus but from the world,
still a pariah nation to all except Turkey. Even the UN Peacekeeping Force
was exactly where it was in 1974, still listlessly patrolling the Green Line, occasionally waxing a pair of still-impounded, still-new 1974 Toyotas.

Nothing has changed except Varosha, which is entering advanced

stages of decay. Its encircling fence and barbed wire are now uniformly
rusted, but there is nothing left to protect but ghosts. An occasional Coca
Cola sign and broadsides posting nightclubs’ cover charges hang on doorways that haven’t seen customers in more than three decades, and now
never will again. Casement windows have flapped and stayed open, their
pocked frames empty of glass. Fallen limestone facing lies in pieces.
Hunks of wall have dropped from buildings to reveal empty rooms, their
furniture long ago somehow spirited away. Paint has dulled; the underlying plaster, where it remains, has yellowed to muted patinas. Where it

Other than the back-and-forth of pigeons, all that moves is the creaky rotor of one last functioning windmill. Hotels—mute and windowless, some with balconies that have fallen, precipitating cascades of damage below—still line the riviera that once aspired to be Cannes or Acapulco. At this point, all parties agree, none is salvageable. Nothing is. To someday once again lure tourists, Varosha will have to be bulldozed and begun anew.

In the meantime, nature continues its reclamation project. Feral gera- niums and philodendrons emerge from missing roofs and pour down ex- terior walls. Flame trees, chinaberries, and thickets of hibiscus, oleander, and passion lilac sprout from nooks where indoors and outdoors now blend. Houses disappear under magenta mounds of bougainvillaea. Lizards and whip snakes skitter through stands of wild asparagus, prickly pear, and six-foot grasses. A spreading ground cover of lemon grass sweet- ens the air. At night, the darkened beachfront, free of moonlight bathers, crawls with nesting loggerhead and green sea turtles.

THE ISLAND OF Cyprus is shaped like a skillet, with its long handle ex- tended toward the Syrian shore. Its pan is gridded with two mountain ranges oriented east-west and divided by a wide central basin—and by the Green Line, with one sierra on each side. The mountains were once cov- ered with Aleppo and Corsican pines, oaks, and cedars. A cypress and ju- niper forest filled the entire central plain between the two ranges. Olive, almond, and carob trees grew on the arid seaward slopes. At the end of the Pleistocene, dwarf elephants the size of cows and pygmy hippopotamuses no bigger than farmyard swine roamed among these trees. Since Cyprus originally rose from the sea, unconnected to the three continents that sur- round it, both species apparently arrived by swimming. They were fol- lowed by humans about 10,000 years ago. At least one archaeological site suggests that the last pygmy hippo was killed and cooked by Homo sapiens hunters.

The trees of Cyprus were prized by Assyrian, Phoenician, and Roman boat builders; during the Crusades, most of them disappeared into the warships of Richard the Lionhearted. By then, the goat population was so large that the plains remained treeless. During the 20th century, planta- tions of umbrella pines were introduced to try to resuscitate former

springs. However, in 1995, following a long drought, nearly all of them
and the remaining native forests in the northern mountains exploded in a
lightning inferno.
Journalist Metin Münir was too grieved to return again from Istanbul
to face his native island in ashes, until a Turkish Cypriot horticulturist,
Hikmet Uluçan, convinced him he needed to see what was happening.
Once again, Münir found that flowers were renewing a Cyprus landscape:
the burnt hillsides were blanketed with crimson poppies. Some poppy
seeds, Uluçan told him, live 1,000 years or more, waiting for fire to clear
trees away so they can bloom.

In the village of Lapta, high above the northern coastline, Hikmet Uluçan
grows figs, cyclamens, cacti, and grapes, and reverently tends the oldest
weeping mulberry in all Cyprus. His moustache, Vandyke beard, and remaining tufts of hair have whitened since he was forced to leave the South
as a young man, where his father had a vineyard and raised sheep, almonds,
olives, and lemons. Until the senseless feud that tore apart his island, 20
generations of Greeks and Turks had shared their valley. Then neighbors
were clubbed to death. They found the smashed body of an old Turkish
woman who had been grazing her goat, the bleating animal still tied to her
wrist. It was barbaric, but Turks were also slaying Greeks. Murderous, mutual loathing between tribes was no more explicable, or complicated, than
the genocidal urges of chimpanzees—a fact of nature that we humans,
vainly or disingenuously, pretend our codes of civilization transcend.
From his garden, Hikmet can see down to the harbor at Kyrenia,
guarded by a seventh-century Byzantine castle built atop Roman fortifications that preceded it. Crusaders and Venetians subsequently took it; then
came Ottomans, then British, and now Turks were having a turn again.
Today a museum, the castle holds one of the world’s rarest relics, a complete Greek merchant ship discovered in 1965, scuttled a mile off Kyrenia.
When it went down, its hold was filled with millstones and hundreds of
ceramic urns containing wine, olives, and almonds. Its cargo was heavy
enough to mire it where currents buried it in mud. Carbon dating of the
almonds it carried, likely picked in Cyprus only days earlier, shows that it
sank about 2,300 years ago.
Shielded from oxygen, the ship’s Aleppo pine hull and timbers

remained intact, although they had to be injected with polyethylene resins
to keep from disintegrating once exposed to air. The boat builders had
used nails of copper, also once plentiful on Cyprus, also impervious to
rust. Equally well preserved are lead fishing weights and the ceramic urns
whose varied styles reveal the Aegean ports of their origin.
The 10-foot-thick walls and curved towers of the castle where the ship is
now displayed are of limestone quarried from the surrounding cliffs, bearing
tiny fossils deposited when Cyprus was beneath the Mediterranean. Since
the island was divided, however, the castle and the fine old stone carob ware-
houses of Kyrenia’s waterfront have all but disappeared behind unlovely in-
festations of casino hotels—gambling and loose currency laws being among
the limited economic options open to a pariah nation.

Hikmet Uluçan drives east along Cyprus’s north coast, passing three more
castles of native limestone rising from the jagged mountains that parallel
the narrow road. Along the headlands and promontories overlooking the
topaz Mediterranean are remains of stone villages, some of them 6,000
years old. Until recently, their terraces, half-buried walls, and jetties were
also visible. Since 2003, however, yet another foreign incursion has as-
saulted the island’s profile. “The only consolation,” mourns Uluçan, “is
that this one can’t last.”
Not crusaders, this time, but elderly British seeking the warmest retire-
ment a middle-class pension can buy, led by a frenzy of developers who dis-
covered in the quasi-country of Northern Cyprus the last cheap, untouched
seafront property left anywhere north of Libya, with pliable zoning codes to
match. Suddenly, bulldozers were scattering 500-year-old olive trees to
scrape roads across hillsides. Waves of red-tiled roofs soon oscillated across
the landscape, atop floor plans cloned repeatedly in poured concrete. Upon
a tsunami of cash payoffs, property agents surfed to shore astride English-
language billboards that appended terms like “Estates,” “Hillside Villas,”
“Seaside Villas,” and “Luxury Villas” to ancient Mediterranean place-names.
Prices from £40,000 to £100,000 ($75,000 to $185,000 U.S.) touched
off a land rush that overwhelmed trifles such as title disputes by Greek
Cypriots who still claimed to own much of the land. A Northern Cyprus
environmental-protection trust vainly protested a new golf course by re-
minding people that they now had to import water from Turkey in giant

vinyl bags; that municipal garbage tips were full; that the total lack of
sewage treatment meant five times as much effluent would pour into the
transparent sea.

Each month more steam shovels gobble coastline like famished bron-
tosaurs, spitting out olive and carob trees along a widening blacktop now
30 miles east of Kyrenia, with no sign of stopping. The English language
marches down the shore, dragging embarrassing architecture with it, one
sign after another announcing the latest subdivision with a trust-inspiring
British name, even as the seaside villas grow trashier: concrete painted, not
stuccoed; fake-ceramic roof tiles made of tacky polymer; cornices and
windows trimmed with faux stenciled stonework. When Hikmet Uluçan
sees a pile of traditional yellow tiles lying in front of naked town house
frames awaiting walls, he realizes that someone is ripping stone facing from
local bridges and selling it to contractors.

Something about these limestone squares lying at the base of skeletal
buildings looks familiar. After a while, he figures it out. “It is like Varosha.”
The half-finished buildings going up, surrounded by construction rubble,
exactly recall the half-ruins of Varosha coming down.

But if anything, quality has sunk even further. Each billboard touting
Northern Cyprus’s sunny new dream homes includes, near the bottom,
notification of the construction guarantee: 10 years. Given rumors of de-
velopers not bothering to wash the sea salt from the beach sand they mine
for concrete, 10 years may be all they get.

Beyond the new golf course, the road finally narrows again. Past one-lane
bridges stripped of their limestone ornaments, and a small canyon filled
with myrtle and pink orchids, it enters the Karpaz Peninsula, the long ten-
dril that reaches east toward the Levant. Along it are empty Greek
churches, gutted but going nowhere, testaments to the tenacity of stone
architecture. Stone structures were among the first things that distin-
guished sedentary humans from nomadic hunter-gatherers, whose tempo-
rary mud-and-wattle huts were no more permanent than the season’s
grass. Stone buildings will be among the last to disappear when we’re
gone. As the fleeting materials of modern construction decompose, the
world will retrace our steps back to the Stone Age as it gradually erodes
away all memory of us.

As the road follows the peninsula, the landscape gets biblical, with old walls turning back to hills as gravity tugs on the underlying clay. The island ends in sand dunes covered by salt scrub and pistachio trees. The beach is smoothed by the belly tracks of mama sea turtles.

A small limestone hill is topped by a lone, branching umbrella pine. Shadows on the rock face turn out to be caves. Closer, the soft parabola of a low-arched portal reveals that it’s been carved. At this windblown land’s end, less than 40 miles across the water to Turkey and only 20 miles more to Syria, the Stone Age began in Cyprus. Humans arrived around the same time that the oldest known building on Earth, a stone tower, was rising in the world’s oldest city that is still inhabited, Jericho. However primitive this Cyprus dwelling is by comparison, it represented a momentous step, albeit one taken some 40,000 years earlier by Southeast Asians who reached Australia—seafarers venturing beyond the horizon, out of sight of the shore, and finding another one waiting.

The cave is shallow, perhaps 20 feet deep, and surprisingly warm. A charcoal-smudged hearth, two benches, and sleeping niches were fashioned by cutting into the sedimentary walls. A second room, smaller than the first, is almost square, with a squared doorway arch.

Remains of *Australopithecus* in South Africa suggest that we were cavemen at least 1 million years ago. In a river bluff grotto at Chauvet-Pont-d’Arc in France, Cro-Magnons not only occupied caves 32,000 years ago, but also turned them into our first art galleries, depicting the European megafauna they sought, or whose strength they wished to channel.

There are no such artifacts here: these first inhabitants of Cyprus were struggling pioneers, their time for aesthetic reflection still ahead. But their bones are buried beneath the floor. Long after all our buildings and what’s left of the tower at Jericho are reduced to sand and soil, caves where we took shelter and first learned the notion of walls—including that they begged for art—will remain. In a world without us, they await the next occupant.

CHAPTER 9

Polymers Are Forever

T HE PORT OF Plymouth in southwestern England is no longer listed among the scenic towns of the British Isles, although prior to World War II it would have qualified. During six nights of March and April 1941, Nazi bombs destroyed 75,000 buildings in what is remembered as the Plymouth Blitz. When the annihilated city center was rebuilt, a modern concrete grid was superimposed on Plymouth’s crooked cobbled lanes, burying its medieval past in memory.

But the main history of Plymouth lies at its edge, in the natural harbor formed at the confluence of two rivers, the Plym and the Tamar, where they join the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean. This is the Plymouth from which the Pilgrims departed; they named their American landfall across the sea in its honor. All three of Captain Cook’s Pacific expeditions began here, as did Sir Francis Drake’s circumnavigation of the globe. And, on December 27, 1831, H.M.S. Beagle set sail from Plymouth Harbor, with 22-year-old Charles Darwin aboard.

University of Plymouth marine biologist Richard Thompson spends a lot of time pacing Plymouth’s historic edge. He especially goes in winter, when the beaches along the harbor’s estuaries are empty—a tall man in jeans, boots, blue windbreaker, and zippered fleece sweater, his bald pate hatless, his long fingers gloveless as he bends to probe the sand. Thompson’s doctoral study was on slimy stuff that mollusks such as limpets and winkles like to eat: diatoms, cyanobacteria, algae, and tiny plants that cling to seaweed. What he’s now known for, however, has less to do with

marine life than with the growing presence of things in the ocean that have never been alive at all. Although he didn’t realize it at the time, what has dominated his life’s work began when he was still an undergraduate in the 1980s, spending autumn weekends organizing the Liverpool contingent of Great Britain’s national beach cleanup. In his final year, he had 170 teammates amassing metric tons of rubbish along 85 miles of shoreline. Apart from items that apparently had dropped from boats, such as Greek salt boxes and Italian oil cruets, from the labels he could see that most of the debris was blowing east from Ireland. In turn, Sweden’s shores were the receptacles for trash from England. Any packaging that trapped enough air to protrude from the water seemed to obey the wind currents, which in these latitudes are easterly. Smaller, lower-profile fragments, however, were apparently controlled by currents in the water. Each year, as he compiled the team’s annual reports, Thompson noticed more and more garbage that was smaller and smaller amid the usual bottles and automobile tires. He and another student began collecting sand samples along beach strand lines. They sieved the tiniest particles of whatever appeared unnatural, and tried to identify them under a microscope. This proved tricky: their subjects were usually too small to allow them to pinpoint the bottles, toys, or appliances from which they sprang. He continued working the annual cleanup during graduate studies at Newcastle. Once he completed his Ph.D. and began teaching at Plymouth, his department acquired a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer, a device that passes a microbeam through a substance, then compares its infrared spectrum to a database of known material. Now he could know what he was looking at, which only deepened his concern. “Any idea what these are?” Thompson is guiding a visitor along the shore of the Plym River estuary, near where it joins the sea. With a full moonrise just a few hours off, the tide is out nearly 200 meters, exposing a sandy flat scattered with bladderwrack and cockle shells. A breeze skims the tidal pools, shivering rows of reflected hillside housing projects. Thompson bends over the strand line of detritus left by the forward edge of waves lapping the shore, looking for anything recognizable: hunks of nylon rope, syringes, topless plastic food containers, half a ship’s float, pebbled remains of polystyrene packaging, and a rainbow of assorted

both caps. Most plentiful of all are multicolored plastic shafts of cotton ear
swabs. But there are also the odd little uniform shapes he challenges people
to identify. Amid twigs and seaweed fibers in his fistful of sand are a couple
of dozen blue and green plastic cylinders about two millimeters high.
“They’re called nurdles. They’re the raw materials of plastic produc-
tion. They melt these down to make all kinds of things.” He walks a little
farther, then scoops up another handful. It contains more of the same
plastic bits: pale blue ones, greens, reds, and tans. Each handful, he calcu-
lates, is about 20 percent plastic, and each holds at least 30 pellets.
“You find these things on virtually every beach these days. Obviously
they are from some factory.”
However, there is no plastic manufacturing anywhere nearby. The pel-
lets have ridden some current over a great distance until they were de-
posited here—collected and sized by the wind and tide.

In Thompson’s laboratory at the University of Plymouth, graduate stu-
dent Mark Browne unpacks foil-wrapped beach samples that arrive in clear
zip-lock bags sent by an international network of colleagues. He transfers
these to a glass separating funnel, filled with a concentrated solution of sea
salt to float off the plastic particles. He filters out some he thinks he rec-
ognizes, such as pieces of the ubiquitous colored ear-swab shafts, to check
under the microscope. Anything really unusual goes to the FTIR Spec-
trometer.
Each takes more than an hour to identify. About one-third turn out to
be natural fibers such as seaweed, another third are plastic, and another
third are unknown—meaning that they haven’t found a match in their
polymer database, or that the particle has been in the water so long its
color has degraded, or that it’s too small for their machine, which analyzes
fragments only to 20 microns—slightly thinner than a human hair.
“That means we’re underestimating the amount of plastic that we’re
finding. The true answer is we just don’t know how much is out there.”
What they do know is that there’s much more than ever before. Dur-
ing the early 20th century, Plymouth marine biologist Alistair Hardy de-
veloped an apparatus that could be towed behind an Antarctic expedition
boat, 10 meters below the surface, to sample krill, and found, incredibly, more plastic by weight than plankton on the ocean's surface.
In fact, it wasn't even close: six times as much.
When he sampled near the mouths of Los Angeles creeks that emptied into the Pacific, the numbers rose by a factor of 100, and kept rising every year. By now he was comparing data with University of Plymouth marine biologist Richard Thompson. Like Thompson, what especially shocked him were plastic bags and the ubiquitous little raw plastic pellets. In India alone, 5,000 processing plants were producing plastic bags. Kenya was churning out 4,000 tons of bags a month, with no potential for recycling.
As for the little pellets known as nurdles, 5.5 quadrillion—about 250
 124 / THE WORLD WITHOUT US
billion pounds—were manufactured annually. Not only was Moore find­ ing them everywhere, but he was unmistakably seeing the plastic resin bits trapped inside the transparent bodies of jellyfish and salps, the ocean's most prolific and widely distributed filter-feeders. Like seabirds, they'd mistaken brightly colored pellets for fish eggs, and tan ones for krill. And now God-knows-how-many quadrillion little pieces more, coated in body- scrub chemicals and perfectly bite-sized for the little creatures that bigger creatures eat, were being flushed seaward.
What did this mean for the ocean, the ecosystem, the future? All this plastic had appeared in barely more than 50 years. Would its chemical con­ stituents or additives—for instance, colorants such as metallic copper— concentrate as they ascended the food chain, and alter evolution? Would it last long enough to enter the fossil record? Would geologists millions of years hence find Barbie doll parts embedded in conglomerates formed in seabed depositions? Would they be intact enough to be pieced together like dinosaur bones? Or would they decompose first, expelling hydrocar­ bons that would seep out of a vast plastic Neptune's graveyard for eons to come, leaving fossilized imprints of Barbie and Ken hardened in stone for eons beyond?
Moore and Thompson began consulting materials experts. Tokyo University geochemist Hideshige Takada, who specialized in EDCs— endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or "gender benders"—had been on a gruesome mission to personally research exactly what evils were leaching from garbage dumps all around Southeast Asia. Now he was examining plastic pulled from the Sea of Japan and Tokyo Bay. He reported that in the sea, nurdles and other plastic fragments acted both as magnets and as sponges for resilient poisons like DDT and PCBs.
The use of aggressively toxic polychlorinated biphenyls—PCBs—to make plastics more pliable had been banned since 1970; among other hazards, PCBs were known to promote hormonal havoc such as her­ maphroditic fish and polar bears. Like time-release capsules, pre-1970 plastic flotsam will gradually leak PCBs into the ocean for centuries. But, as Takada also discovered, free-floating toxins from all kinds of sources—copy paper, automobile grease, coolant fluids, old fluorescent tubes, and infamous discharges by General Electric and Monsanto plants

directly into streams and rivers—readily stick to the surfaces of free- floating plastic.
One study directly correlated ingested plastics with PCBs in the fat tissue of puffins. The astonishing part was the amount. Takada and his colleagues found that plastic pellets that the birds ate concentrate poisons to levels as high as 1 million times their normal occurrence in seawater.
By 2005, Moore was referring to the gyrating Pacific dump as 10 mil­ lion square miles—nearly the size of Africa. It wasn't the only one: the planet has six other major tropical oceanic gyres, all of them swirling with ugly debris. It was as if plastic exploded upon the world from a tiny seed after World War II and, like the Big Bang, was still expanding. Even if all production suddenly ceased, an astounding amount of the astoundingly durable stuff was already out there. Plastic debris, Moore believed, was now the most common surface feature of the world's oceans. How long would it last? Were there any benign, less-immortal substitutes that civi­ lization could convert to, lest the world be plastic-wrapped evermore?
That fall, Moore, Thompson, and Takada convened at a marine plastic summit in Los Angeles with Dr. Anthony Andrady. A senior research sci­ entist at North Carolina's Research Triangle, Andrady is from Sri Lanka, one of South Asia's rubber-producing powers. While studying polymer science in graduate school, he was distracted from a career in rubber by the surging plastics industry. An 800-page tome he eventually compiled, Plas­ tics in the Environment, won him acclaim from the industry and environ­ mentalists alike as the oracle on its subject.
The long-term prognosis for plastic, Andrady told assembled marine scientists, is exactly that: long-term. It's no surprise that plastics have made an enduring mess in the oceans, he explained. Their elasticity, versatility (they can either sink or float), near invisibility in water, durability, and su­ perior strength were exactly why net and fishing line manufacturers had abandoned natural fibers for synthetics such as nylon and polyethylene. In time, the former disintegrate; the latter, even when torn and lost, continue "ghost fishing." As a result, virtually every marine species, including whales, is in danger of being snared by great tangles of nylon loose in the oceans.
Like any hydrocarbon, Andrady said, even plastics "inevitably must

biodegrade, but at such a slow rate that it is of little practical consequence. They can, however, photodegrade in a meaningful time frame."
He explained: When hydrocarbons biodegrade, their polymer mole­ cules are disassembled into the parts that originally combined to create them: carbon dioxide and water. When they photodegrade, ultraviolet solar radiation weakens plastic's tensile strength by breaking its long, chain-like polymer molecules into shorter segments. Since the strength of plastics de­ pends on the length of their intertwined polymer chains, as the UV rays snap them, the plastic starts to decompose.
Everyone has seen polyethylene and other plastics turn yellow and brittle and start to flake in sunlight. Often, plastics are treated with addi­ tives to make them more UV-resistant; other additives can make them more UV-sensitive. Using the latter for six-pack rings, Andrady suggested, might save the lives of many sea creatures.
However, there are two problems. For one, plastic takes much longer to photodegrade in water. On land, plastic left in the sun absorbs infrared heat, and is soon much hotter than the surrounding air. In the ocean, not only does it stay cooled by water, but fouling algae shield it from sunlight.
The other hitch is that even though a ghost fishnet made from pho- todegradable plastic might disintegrate before it drowns any dolphins, its chemical nature will not change for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.
"Plastic is still plastic. The material still remains a polymer. Polyethyl­ ene is not biodegraded in any practical time scale. There is no mechanism in the marine environment to biodegrade that long a molecule." Even if photodegradable nets helped marine mammals live, he concluded, their powdery residue remains in the sea, where the filter feeders will find it.
"Except for a small amount that's been incinerated," says Tony Andrady the oracle, "every bit of plastic manufactured in the world for the last 50 years or so still remains. It's somewhere in the environment."
That half-century's total production now surpasses 1 billion tons. It includes hundreds of different plastics, with untold permutations involv­ ing added plasticizers, opacifiers, colors, fillers, strengtheners, and light stabilizers. The longevity of each can vary enormously. Thus far, none has disappeared. Researchers have attempted to find out how long it will take

 POLYMERS ARE FOREVER / \1J
polyethylene to biodegrade by incubating a sample in a live bacteria cul­ ture. A year later, less than 1 percent was gone.
"And that's under the best controlled laboratory conditions. That's not what you will find in real life," says Tony Andrady. "Plastics haven't been around long enough for microbes to develop the enzymes to handle it, so they can only biodegrade the very-low-molecular-weight part of the plastic"—meaning, the smallest, already-broken polymer chains. Although truly biodegradable plastics derived from natural plant sugars have ap­ peared, as well as biodegradable polyester made from bacteria, the chances of them replacing the petroleum-based originals aren't great.
"Since the idea of packaging is to protect food from bacteria," An­ drady observes, "wrapping leftovers in plastic that encourages microbes to eat it may not be the smartest thing to do."
But even if it worked, or even if humans were gone and never pro­ duced another nurdle, all the plastic already produced would remain— how long?
"Egyptian pyramids have preserved corn, seeds, and even human parts such as hair because they were sealed away from sunlight with little oxygen or moisture," says Andrady, a mild, precise man with a broad face and a clipped, persuasively reasonable voice. "Our waste dumps are somewhat like that. Plastic buried where there's little water, sun, or oxygen will stay intact a long time. That is also true if it is sunk in the ocean, covered with sediment. At the bottom of the sea, there's no oxygen, and it's very cold."
He gives a clipped little laugh. "Of course," he adds, "we don't know much about microbiology at those depths. Possibly anaerobic organisms there can biodegrade it. It's not inconceivable. But no one's taken a sub­ mersible down to check. Based on our observations, it's unlikely. So we ex­ pect much-slower degradation at the sea bottom. Many times longer. Even an order of magnitude longer."
An order of magnitude—that's 10 times—longer than what? One thousand years? Ten thousand?
No one knows, because no plastic has died a natural death yet. It took today's microbes that break hydrocarbons down to their building blocks a long time after plants appeared to learn to eat lignin and cellulose. More recently, they've even learned to eat oil. None can digest plastic yet, be­ cause 50 years is too short a time for evolution to develop the necessary biochemistry.

"But give it 100,000 years," says Andrady the optimist. He was in his native Sri Lanka when the Christmas 2004 tsunami hit, and even there, after those apocalyptic waters struck, people found reason to hope. "I'm sure you'll find many species of microbes whose genes will let them do this tremendously advantageous thing, so that their numbers will grow and prosper. Today's amount of plastic will take hundreds of thousands of years to consume, but, eventually, it will all biodegrade. Lignin is far more complex, and it biodegrades. It's just a matter of waiting for evolu­ tion to catch up with the materials we are making."
And should biologic time run out and some plastics remain, there is al­ ways geologic time.
"The upheavals and pressure will change it into something else. Just like trees buried in bogs a long time ago—the geologic process, not biodégradation, changed them into oil and coal. Maybe high concentra­ tions of plastics will turn into something like that. Eventually, they will change. Change is the hallmark of nature. Nothing remains the same."
