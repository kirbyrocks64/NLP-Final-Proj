Amy Godine,1,"men fought slavery. Its centrality in their lives ensured this. Some settlers on the Smith Land had been slaves in their youth, or were the children of ex-slaves, or had ex-slaves for ministers, grandparents, or spouses. Even when their families were decades out of slavery, reenslave-ment was ever thinkable. Upstate Black New Yorkers recalled how use-less was Solomon Northup’s free status was when, in 1841, he was lured from upstate Saratoga Springs to Washington, DC, with the promise of a job, then drugged, jailed, and sold to a Louisiana planter—and Northup the son of an Adirondack farmer-voter. Especially after the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Act, enslavement menaced every free Black person in the North. And because Black Northerners felt slavery as an existential threat, they knew, as white people could not, why only war could smash it. A system as entrenched, confident, and profitable as the one that stole John Thomas’s first wife and snatched twelve years from the life of Solomon Northup—a system whose defenders would sooner leave the nation than cede the right to hold human beings as chattel—would yield only to force. 245 246 CHAPTER 14 So Black Northerners felt no ambivalence about John Brown’s wild raid that pitched half the nation into a lashing paranoia and roused the other half to the grim defense of nationhood and law. The raid that has-tened the long war that, alone, offered the hope of justice and relief for millions was a reckoning. Let it come. The man Herman Melville called “the Meteor of the War” changed the world. And this meteor had been their friend! It was another thing that set the Black settlers’ Civil War apart. Long before his name was claimed by Union soldiers on the march, John Brown belonged to the Black Woods. His Black neighbors knew his wife and children, his facility with a surveyor’s transit, his fierce faith, his taste in hymns. Private Hasbrook’s father got lost in a snowstorm and was led to safety by John Brown. Private Carasaw’s wife, Eliza, mended clothes for Brown’s wife. Private Appo’s father sold Brown’s daughter a melodeon when she got married. If the men of the Black Woods fought for the slave, they also fought to honor the memory of their white ally and true friend.1 For most of them, however, there would be no fighting until the war was halfway over. Until January 1864, Black men who lived within a wagon ride of John Brown’s grave were denied the right to bear arms for the Union—as were Black men all over the free North whose efforts to enlist were categorically rebuffed. In New York City, mobs broke up ad hoc Black militias; in Providence, Black-initiated drills were outlawed as “disorderly gatherings.” As Benjamin Quarles observes in The Negro in the Civil War, “There seemed to be a common sentiment that the only military command that Negroes should hear was, ‘As you were.’” But in the Black Woods, the rejection registered as more than legal. It took aim at the hope of justice and equality that drew Black families to this wilderness in the first place, and that had seemed to set this land apart.2 Avery Hazzard and his white neighbors in St. Armand were of one pioneering generation. They knew each other’s barns and crops, took the other’s side against the tax collector. Avery’s father, Levi, fought for three years with his Massachusetts regiment in the War of Inde-pendence. At the outbreak of the Civil War, three grandsons of this pa-triot—Charles Henry, Alexander, and George—hoped to fight as much as their white neighbors, who were so keen to enlist that they were mak-ing city headlines. (“In St. Armand, N.Y., [near] where John Brown lived and was buried, of the eighty voters in the town, seventy have enlisted,” the New York Times reported in 1862.) But when the war began, the pliable constraints of caste hardened into federal policy. So white Ad-irondackers marched to fife and drum, and Black men stood apart with TO ARMS! 247 women, children, and old men, cheering on white patriots even as they struggled to ignore this bitter insult here about the white man’s greater worthiness for battle.3 And this, of course, was the third thing that set their Civil War apart: they, not their white friends, had to deal with an army that held them stiffly at arm’s length—or, as historian Benjamin Quarles put it, to suf-fer a wartime government that “measured out . . . rights for Negroes . . . in homeopathic doses and administered with a long spoon.” The for-mation of Black regiments in New York would be delayed fully a year after federal policy gave Black men fighting rights (and delayed by the same governor, Horatio Seymour, who in 1868 made his campaign slogan for the presidency “This Is a White Man’s Country. Let White Men Rule”). Even after February 1864, when Black volunteers were finally, grudgingly, allowed to serve, given rifles, and dispatched to fight, the army stalled their progress. Black fighting men were paid less. They got worse gear. They got less medical attention than white soldiers, and suffered greater rates of injury and a death rate 35 per-cent higher than what white troops endured. In the South, these sol-diers would be exposed to racialized atrocities and war crimes that white soldiers seldom faced. In effect, they fought three adversaries to the white man’s two. White enlistees went to beat a sectional re-bellion, and those who were abolitionists (never a majority) battled slavery as well. Black soldiers fought the rebels, the slaveocracy, and (maybe worst of all) an enemy their white friends never knew: the rote presumption of Black inferiority.4 And this foe, unlike the enemy of white fighters, was unconcerned with legal treaties or military defeat. When General Lee raised the flag of truce at Appomattox, white Union men knew victory was theirs, and they were done. Black soldiers reveled in the defeat of the Con-federacy too, but white racism did not surrender. It lost a uniform; it kept its guns. That only eight men from the Black Woods joined the Union army suggests how much the Black community had dwindled since the give-away’s debut. And while this meager list would double if I beefed it up with grantees or their sons who joined the army from elsewhere in the Adirondacks (Westport, Willsboro, Elizabethtown), or who en-listed after they were well out of the region (like Willis Hodges, who scouted for the Union in Virginia, or the fighting sons of Samuel and Thomas Jefferson), or if I stretched it with the names of emancipated African Americans who discovered Franklin and St. Armand when the 248 CHAPTER 14 war was over, this would only obscure the view. If the point is to track what the Adirondacks signified for African Americans who were living in the Smith Lands when they enlisted, and to consider how the war years shaped their prospects and their expectations on their return, the focus has to stay with those for whom the Black Woods was the start-ing point. And so we have these eight, and offer here, in the rough order of their enlistments, a bit of what we know about the war years of North Elba’s William Appo Jr., Silas Frazier, William Carasaw, and Josiah Hasbrook; St. Armand’s Charles Henry Hazzard; and Franklin’s Warren Morehouse, James Brady, and Samuel Brady.5 William Appo Jr., first in this list to answer President Lincoln’s call for volunteers, signed up in North Elba in early 1861. He was nineteen and had been living in North Elba for perhaps a year with his father, William Sr. Why did he not enlist from his parents’ year-round home in Burlington, New Jersey? Maybe he tried and was rebuffed, and that’s why he was here. He was mixed-race. Nonwhites were not welcome in the army. But Appo Sr.’s 1848 purchase of a good-sized lot in North Elba was a significant investment that pioneers, both Black and white, probably appreciated. And when the light-skinned Appo Jr. (both of his parents were listed as “mulatto” in the census) volunteered to serve his country, some North Elbans, eager for volunteers, may have recalled his father’s first show of faith and thought to return the favor. What-ever the reason for this exception, young Appo made the cut. From North Elba, he registered in the all-white US Army and was directed to the Thirtieth Regiment, New York Infantry, Company I, in Troy in 1861. He was the first man from the Black Woods to join a white regiment in defiance of the color law. Surely his father, an army man himself when he was a youth in Haiti, saluted his resolve.6 Appo’s officers would flag their confidence in this volunteer early on. Only five months after he mustered in, Appo was made corporal. His regiment engaged in twenty-six skirmishes and thirty battles. With the Army of the Potomac, it fought in the First Battle of Bull Run (also called Manassas) and other battles, and it returned to this old killing field with the Army of Virginia in late August 1862. The Second Battle of Bull Run was distinguished by a day of legendarily horrific carnage in an abandoned railroad cut corralled with weedy culverts, digs, and embankments, which gave Confederate general Thomas W. “Stonewall” Jackson all the breastworks and protection his men would need to seize the day. Sixty-two thousand Union troops fought in the Second Battle TO ARMS! 249 of Bull Run. A fifth of them, some fourteen thousand men, died in one day. In the Deep Cut, Corporal Appo joined his comrades in a mass grave. His remains were not recovered.7 Some years after the war, his father had a stone with his son’s name on it placed near his own marker in the Lake Placid cemetery, and much later, in the late twentieth century, a World War II veteran and retired schoolteacher in Lake Placid, Charles Thomas, honored this slain sol-dier’s marker with a Grand Army of the Republic star and a flag. But the flag and star would be removed in 2001 at the insistence of the town historian. Only graves or markers with bodies in the ground were entitled to these honors, she declared, and Appo’s body wasn’t buried. Never mind that there was no body. None that might have been identi-fied had ever been recovered. Mary MacKenzie was unswayed.8 Not so Greg Furness, an Adirondack friend I shared this story with when I learned about it in the summer of 2022. Greg, his old job in state historic preservation well behind him, has spent a lot of time in his retirement in old Adirondack cemeteries, cleaning and repairing old graves, making sure Civil War veterans get their due. On Veterans Day 2022, a message with a picture showed up in my inbox. A small flag ris-ing from its holder in a new-ordered GAR Civil War marker in back of William Appo’s stone looked right at home.9 Franklin’s Warren Morehouse was also keen to take up arms. And when New York’s Negrophobic governor, Horatio Seymour, failed to reward the interest of New York’s prospective Black volunteers, More-house, with 223 other Black New Yorkers, thought of Massachusetts, whose antislavery governor, John Andrew, put out a call for Black enlist-ees after President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863. A few months later, Lincoln signed the federal Enrollment Act, directing every congressional district in the Union to meet a soldiers’ quota, either by a draft or by voluntary enlistment. Compulsory con-scription was never popular, North or South, and Union states has-tened to expedite enlistment with bonuses and bounties. These were meaningful and timely boosts for poor men who could not leave de-pendents for three years unsupported. That six of the eight volunteers from the Black Woods enlisted after the passage of the Enrollment Act indicates they took their domestic obligations seriously. Now that their families were assured of some relief, they could leave them in good con-science. Morehouse headed east.10 At the railway depot in Boston that September in 1863, this Ad-irondacker, not a knuckle over five feet tall, told the recruiter for the 250 CHAPTER 14 Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth Colored Infantry that he was twenty-one. He was actually more like seventeen, but fudging birthdates was a ven-erable military tradition. Did the gray Atlantic, with its tang of brine and wheeling gulls, bedazzle him? Not half so much, I imagine, as the sight of Black enlistees rolling into Boston from as many as twenty-four states. Black men and boys from all over the East! In his Blackness, Morehouse now had company. Blackness, in his regiment, was for once not outside of things (not the young Black axman in William Sidney Mount’s painting, lingering outside a barn to eavesdrop on the white fiddlers sawing out a tune inside). Blackness was his world now. It had his back; it gave him standing, friends, and mentors. It made a home.11 Morehouse’s years with the Fifty-Fourth also stretched his under-standing of the hundred ways the enemies of Blackness schemed to break his body, soul, and heart. He expected a rough time from the reb-els—but from his own side too? Not only did Black volunteers receive less pay than white soldiers (and had to buy their uniforms, as whites did not), but they could expect less expert medical attention, their hospitals were undermanned and insufficiently supplied, and they en-dured significantly higher rates of injury and death. They hoped for glory in the battlefield; instead they dug encampments and trenches for amputated limbs, tended horses, emptied latrines, heaved coal, cooked for their white officers, and brewed their tea. (The Ninety-Sixth New York Infantry, a northern New York regiment that organized in Platts-burgh, signed up seven “colored cooks”; Malone’s Ninety-Eighth Regi- ment Infantry had thirteen.)12 Also new for this backwoods youth: his first encounter with Black men from New York City, many of them still reeling from the draft riots that shocked Manhattan in mid-July. This four-day rampage, ostensibly a protest against President Lincoln’s call for compulsory conscription, left as many as 1,200 Black people dead. “Satan has been let loose in this city upon the poor negro,” a reporter wrote Gerrit Smith about this American pogrom. Rev. Henry Highland Garnet recalled rioters hack-ing Black bodies to bits and peddling “Nigger meat.” McCune Smith’s Colored Orphan Asylum was put to the torch, and he took his fam-ily and medical practice from Manhattan. Elder Ray shut his church down, and when the riot was subdued, he returned to the old neighbor-hoods to solace traumatized survivors with food and medicine. “None know excepting those who have witnessed it the extent of the suffering among them,” the minister despaired. Some of the New York recruits Morehouse met at the Camp Meigs training ground south of Boston TO ARMS! 251 were here as much to get out of Manhattan as to join the army. And what an irony that the first refugees Morehouse encountered in the service would not be contrabands down South but free Black men in flight from white rage in the North.13 Morehouse also learned from his new comrades about the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Colored’s harsh defeat that summer at Fort Wag-ner. Frederick Douglass’s eldest son, Sergeant Major Lewis H. Douglass, survived that battle (but later injuries would kill his military prospects). Outside Charleston, the Fifty-Fourth had led a charge of many regi-ments to retake Fort Wagner’s earthworks, but without cover or suf-ficient numbers, and immobilized by crossfire, the Black troops, Dou-glass reported, were simply “cut to pieces.” One witness saw the bodies of Black soldiers heaped so high a man could walk fifty yards across them and never touch the ground. Yet—here was the thing—no other regiment did so much damage to the rebels’ fortifications, or made such a lasting name for guts. Garlanded by Union editors and church-men, the martyrs of the Fifty-Fourth Colored inspired thousands of Black hopefuls to enlist in the Black regiments. So, while devastating to the Fifty-Fourth, this regiment’s good work that day also signified a victory, a vindication of Frederick Douglass’s promise: “Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters U.S., let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder, and bullets in his pocket, and there is no power on earth or under the earth which can deny that he has earned the right of citizenship.”14 Colonel Robert Shaw, the abolitionist Bostonian who headed up the Fifty-Fourth Colored, was killed and buried in a mass grave with his men. To Confederates who judged this a deserved insult, Shaw’s family would say their slain son would count an integrated grave the highest honor. And Morehouse may have deemed it an honor to join a regiment so renowned for its abolition leadership. He had been hearing about slavery and abolitionists—such as Gerrit Smith, his family’s benefactor, and Troy’s Garnet, who made his father one of his “Pick’d Men.” At dusk at the Readville parade ground, Boston’s abolitionists gathered on the sidelines, there to “take the greatest pleasure in watching the de-velopment of the negroes as soldiers,” join them at their evening prayer, and salute the new band’s “steady and daily improvement” in its one martial tune. So recalled the writer Henry Bowditch, whose family lived close by.15 But the more lasting memories would be what Morehouse witnessed in the South, and as he marched with his company into the South 252 CHAPTER 14 Carolina backcountry, the dry dust swimming up around his boots, the young private saw all he needed to know why he was here. Old men and children in feed sacks and string belts, shoeless, straggling out to greet him; cotton fields hazed with smoke; slave quarters the size of corn cribs next to fine pillared homes; and sometimes (recalled the regi-mental memoirist) the only sound “the tinkle, tinkle of pans and cups, striking the bayonets for music.” Most Black people here were welcom-ing, of course, but some, of course, still registered their incredulity. Black men in blue, eyes front, bearing arms. What cold new trickery was this?16 Private Morehouse’s war was long, and in the course of it some of Black America’s best allies would lose patience with the abolition course. In stumping for the Union, Gerrit Smith, the Black Woods’ benefactor and the bondsman’s long and faithful friend, now repeatedly declared the Union cause a greater passion, or at least priority, than his devotion to Black freedom. Well, the old man could speechify away. Morehouse fought for the slave—and, according to the regimental history, fought nervily and well. In Olustee, Florida, the Adirondacker, “chaf[ing]” for “aggressive action,” “crept out” to take aim at the enemy. At Boykin’s Mill (the last skirmish in South Carolina), Morehouse, walking point, spied “Johnnies” in a barn, intelligence that led his captain to change the plan of attack (and to note this private’s contribution in his memoir). Morehouse would be tapped to serve in his regimental hospital, a repeat assignment that spanned months. At notoriously short-staffed, under-supplied Colored Regimental Hospitals, the work was ceaseless, urgent, and demoralizing. Morehouse was unfazed. Before the war and after, Adirondack inns had hired him as a camp cook, waiter, and hunter; versatility was his gift. Toward the end of his service, the army made him a regimental marker. Quickness, confidence, precision—troops in formation relied on the “RM” as an orchestra looks to the conductor. Morehouse kept the lines straight, then turned them on a dime. When he mustered out in August 1865, he looked forward to a hundred-dollar bounty and, like his mates, had plans for every cent.17 From St. Armand, the farmer Charles Henry Hazzard enlisted with the Adirondack Regiment, the NY 118th, likely delighting the enlist-ment officer since Hazzard’s signature could help this village meet its quota. But higher-ups would catch the breach of army policy, and within a week this volunteer was redirected to the NY Twenty-Sixth US Colored. Just after Christmas in 1863, Hazzard mustered in at Rikers Island. His younger brother, Alexander, also hoped to serve, but left no military record and may have joined a home militia.18 TO ARMS! 253 Also headed for the Colored Twenty-Sixth: North Elba’s grantee-farmer William Carasaw and his younger neighbor Josiah Hasbrook, who, like Hazzard, was a grantee’s son. These two went to Clinton County to enlist, accompanied that day by the farmer Leonard Worts, long a Hasbrook family friend. Josiah’s older brother, Simeon, already living in Manhattan, had enlisted too. In the US Navy was no lower rank than landsman, but the pay was regular and the job was sure. Simeon served on a half-dozen navy vessels and a whaling bark before he quit the sea in 1870.19 From Plattsburgh, Black enlistees in the Twenty-Sixth Colored took the train to New York City to collect their guns and uniforms and start training at Rikers Island. Still in his civvies, a stony-faced Carasaw got his picture taken at the Cady Photo Gallery on Canal Street, close to the Union League Club. This powerful fraternity, staunchly pro-Lincoln and the Union cause, oversaw the recruitment, training, and provisioning of three Black New York regiments representing 4,125 men in 1863 and 1864. Gerrit Smith gave $3,000 to these regiments (to the Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth he gave $500), and he and the philanthropist George H. Stearns bankrolled the whistle-stop recruiting tours of Douglass and the Albany reformer Stephen Myers for Black regiments in Boston and New York. Also working for the new regiments were some of Smith’s old land agents for the Black Woods. At Rikers Island, Reverend Garnet min-istered to Black recruits (Gerrit Smith gave money for their medicine and nursing). Rev. Jermain Loguen lined up Black enlistees in central New York (a Binghamton militia, “Loguen’s Guards,” joined Black regi-ments as they were formed).20 The Twenty-Sixth USCT never suffered the frontline casualties of the Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth. In South Carolina, where Has-brook’s Company B was engaged, the long humid days were occupied with the isolating work of manning forts and batteries (in Hasbrook’s case, near Hilton Head Island in the Port Royal Sound). The regi-ment was also charged with busting up Confederate-held rail lines, sallies that never came to much but let these soldiers test their guns at Honey Hill, Tullifinny Station (Devaux’s Neck), and McKay’s Point. Here, in the Carolina low country, disease would be the soldiers’ most malicious foe. Private Carasaw caught the “Southern fever,” which saddled him with asthma, bouts of fever, and a weak heart all his life. Prolonged exposure and malaria left Private Hazzard with recur-ring fevers, a bad kidney, and bouts of bloody urine. Chronic chills and disabling fevers, along with deafness from the measles, were the 254 CHAPTER 14 Private William Carasaw, 26th Reg. USCT. Photograph, carte de visite. Cady Gallery, NYC. New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center, Saratoga Springs, NY. war-made, enduring lot of Private Hasbrook. Rheumatism plagued them all.21 Still, some interludes were joyful. In Beaufort, South Carolina, Haz-zard wooed Julia Smith, an emancipated slave and the laundress of a Union officer. They were married by the regimental chaplain, Benjamin F. Randolph, in May 1865. Witnessing their vows were Julia’s daugh-ter Clara, and Private Hasbrook from North Elba. Hazzard, Carasaw, and Hasbrook belonged to different companies, but in Beaufort they sought and found each other, and the home ties were a life saver. When Hasbrook was laid up with the measles, his old friends got him medi-cine, and when Carasaw, the oldest of the three, seemed too weak to muster out, his comrades saw to it that he got home alive.22 Private Hazzard and his bride may have thought of staying south. Ex-slaves were starting up small farms on appropriated rebel land. The ex-slave Private Jeremiah Miles, a new friend of the Adirondackers, worked for hire on these reclaimed lots. In 1866, this army teamster TO ARMS! 255 raised cotton for a government “collector” at the Gabriel Capers plan-tation on St. Helena Island. At the outset, it looked promising. Yankee speculators and the Federals talked a good game about the collabora-tive role of wage labor in the postbellum plantation economy. But Black hands were often paid late and sometimes not paid at all, and those who farmed for themselves were learning how easily Yankee contractors could seize their land. Private Hazzard, used to running his own show, would have grasped what Black freed people were fighting in this post-war economy. Not only was the pay inequitable and the labor contracts ironclad, but the race hate of the old guard was as strong as ever. Some bosses working for the Yankees were the same overseers who had ter-rorized Black families under slavery. Many vanquished whites bridled at any bid for Black economic autonomy, and Black veterans from the North were particularly despised. Hazzard, Julia, his new stepdaughters Clara and Genevia, and the ex-slave Jeremiah Miles were wise to push on north. Forced evictions would eventually displace tens of thousands of Black homesteaders all over the South, forever shattering the eman-cipated slaves’ long dream of forty acres and a mule.23 As for the chaplain who heard Charles and Julia’s vows, Benjamin Randolph remained in the South, working for the Freedmen’s Bureau, writing for a Black reform newspaper, and pushing for integrated pub-lic transportation. He was a delegate to a South Carolina Constitu-tional Convention. In Orangeburg County he ran for state senator and won; an “electioneering tour” followed. It was while on tour in Abbev-ille County, changing trains, that this Northern reformer was accosted by three white men brandishing pistols. Witnesses to the group assas-sination were many. Local rumor credited an ex-Confederate colonel with the idea. No arrests were made.24 The same Christmas of 1863 that Charles Hazzard got to Rikers for his training, his North Elba neighbor, Silas Frazier, forty-three, enlisted in a white regiment, the Second New York Volunteer Cavalry then seeking Essex County volunteers. Not one of Smith’s “pick’d men” but a fellow traveler who bought thirty acres in the Black Woods from a grantee, then settled on another lot he liked better, this discriminating home-steader and his wife, Jane, came to North Elba from Newburgh on the Hudson. Childless and undistracted, they built their farm up fast. They kept pigs, sheep, cows, and oxen, raised hay, wheat, and rye, made butter for the market, and tapped enough maple sap to sell. Known in West-port as a “strong, healthy, able-bodied” fellow, Frazier also hired out. 256 CHAPTER 14 In Keene, onlookers at a turkey shoot recalled the day this “fighting man” of “mixed blood” took on “Riley Blood, a staunch Democrat and a hotelkeeper. Blood had no use for colored persons,” recalled John Brown’s son Salmon. Frazier knocked him flat. Army mates in the Sec-ond New York Cavalry described Frazier as “one of the strongest and most robust men in his Company,” the “perfect picture of health.”25 That picture cracked for good a year after Frazier donned his blues. On a Louisiana wintry day in 1864, his company was canvassing the ter-ritory around Union-occupied Morganza, checking for rebel vigilantes at surrounding farms. When the horse ahead of Frazier’s stumbled and went down, Frazier swung off his horse and rushed to his army mate now pinned under his mount. Kicking wildly, the injured horse caught Frazier in the gut. The damage never healed. He quit the cavalry—he had to—and he never rode again. But he owed the Union two more years, and he was counting on that government pay. Frazier found work as a galley cook on a navy steamer, the Augusta Dinsmore, and then he picked up dysentery. This new blow disabled him completely, and he finally mus-tered out. Back in the Adirondacks, Private Frazier and his wife settled on a twenty-acre farm lot in Westport, which put him within reach of a physician and the kind of “choring around” he could manage. But the life of a frontiersman was a memory. Until his death in 1874, this veteran contended with unremitting pain.26 The last of the eight from the Black Woods to take up arms for the Union were James and Samuel Brady. Neither were grantees. They found the Black Woods from New Jersey in the mid-1850s. All the gift lots were parceled out by the time they got to Franklin, and in any case, as out-of-staters, they did not qualify for Smith’s largesse. They didn’t care. What tugged them north was the bright thread of a rumor. Here was country, wild, still unmade, where Black people could homestead and white people would leave them be—an important asset here, since, as circumstantial evidence suggests, the Marylanders James Brady; his wife, Louisa; her son, Samuel, by a previous marriage; Louisa’s father, Josiah Bunion; and a young friend or relative of this family, Mary Eliza-beth Bailey from Delaware, were fugitives.27 Were the Black Woods what they hoped for? So many Black families had given up. But from those who’d stayed and their white neighbors they found work and a welcome. By 1860, James and Louisa Brady and Mary Bailey occupied a cabin near the home of the grantee Wesley Mur-ray and his young family. Samuel Brady, Louisa’s teenage son, was a hired hand living in the home of a white family nearby. Old Josiah Bunion TO ARMS! 257 bunked with George Holland, a young grantee from Westchester. John Thomas, originally from Maryland, and his wife and two daughters were farming in this neighborhood (a hard year for this family, marking the death of Richard, just sixteen). Fifteen Black people lived in this small rurality in 1860. And of the nine who hailed from the South (and likely formerly enslaved), four were farming land they called their own.28 James Brady joined the 118th Regiment, NY Infantry, Company C, in June 1862, fourteen months after the war began. Not so his young stepson Samuel, whose mother, Louisa, needed help on the farm. As the army beefed up incentives to enlist, however, Samuel reconsidered. From 1863 to 1864, the Franklin County budget shot up",203166
Anne Therese Gennari,1,"by the shore, or you can choose to dive in and swim with the dolphins. You can spend your days caring about other people’s social media stories, or you can go out in the world and create your own—not stories to share on your feed, but stories just for you, your story. To be the center of your own saga, you need to be fully here. And to be fully here, you need to be aware; aware of your surroundings, your emotions and feelings, how your actions affect others, and how other people affect you. By becoming aware, you dive into the depths of something scary, because suddenly you’re not just dipping your toes anymore—you’re swimming with the dolphins. And yes, that can be intimidating, but it’s also where the magic comes into play. Awareness is kind of like magic. With those gates flung open, you will start to see and feel the world around you in a whole new light. You will pay attention to all the beautiful things around you, things that allow you to have hope in the world, like the small acts of kindness you will begin to see between people. When you’re fully aware, you will start to notice how someone at the bus stop lends a hand to help the older person up the stairs or how someone stops to listen to the homeless person playing violin and drops a dollar in the bucket. Noticing these small moments will begin to transform your life. You will start to understand how much they actually matter, which will make you feel like you matter too. You will begin to see that your actions, no matter how small, matter. That is what awareness brings—the feeling of connectedness, hope, and that what we do makes a difference. In other words—awareness allows you to see love. However, once you open those gates, everything will gain entry. And the truth is there is also a lot of ugliness in the world. Just as you can now see and feel the love, you will also be able to truthfully see and feel the pain. However, and here’s the point I’m trying to hammer home, your heart can take it. Not only can it take it, but in feeling it all, by being brave and saying yes to life and all the messiness that comes with it, you activate what we all need so much right now—healing. The question you ought to be asking yourself is why those awareness gates closed to begin with. If having them open is the key to truly living, why are we so bad at staying aware? There are probably a thousand reasons, but here are two worth paying attention to. First, our focus is literally being stolen,1 and the devices we keep walking around with make staying aware awfully hard to do. Second, it’s hard to want to stay aware of the kind of information we’re introduced to every day (thanks to those tiny devices). Let’s be real. We consume a ton of potential shit every day. I say “shit” because a lot of what we learn daily is pretty shitty (i.e., doom and gloom) and also shit because half the time we aren’t sure if what we learn is even true. How often do we actually have time to fact-check everything we hear and read? We’re keeping our information gates open for business at all times, and no one is at the door checking ID or proof of vaccination. No one is making sure whatever passes through our veil of consciousness actually benefits us —or the world—or if it’s even something we believe in. Often, what we let pass through makes us stressed, worried, and even sick, but how often do we take a second to reflect on whether we feel shitty for a good reason? We live in a super-connected world, and because of it, we have access to a lot of information. Often this information is accessible with just a swipe of a finger. Since happy news doesn’t sell (and because, let’s face it, we humans are drama queens), what we learn can easily make us feel like the world is going under. Yet we keep consuming negative news, after negative news, after negative news, like it’s our civic duty to learn everything there is to know. What we don’t do is allow for the emotional space to process what we’re learning. We don’t take the time to process. How can we care about children starving in refugee camps or wildfires running amok when our life is filled to the brim as it is? How would we even function if we were to tap into and feel each devastating news story? If you ever catch yourself feeling overwhelmed, give yourself a break. We are exposed to more information every day than our ancestors were in their lifetimes. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by one of these stories, not to mention a trillion of them, so honestly…how do we deal? How have our fragile hearts not crashed yet? The answer is we find ways to numb ourselves. We simply close those awareness gates so we can stay informed, yet not quite aware of what’s going on. TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, dating apps, Netflix, YouTube, video games…distraction after distraction makes it a little easier to stay dutifully informed, but with clouded hearts. What we’re dealing with here are two unattended gates, and they both need to be staffed with new people. Gate number one is the doorway through which we allow all this crazy information to pass. We believe the more we know, the smarter we come across, and the more accepted we’ll be by the people around us. That is why we keep those gates wide open— because we want to be “in the know.” We also want to be able to showcase this knowledge to other people, so if someone shares something that seems to be worth knowing about, an Instagram story, for example, we might be triggered to share the same information so you can show you’re in the know too. Don’t take my word for it. As I mentioned earlier, a Harvard University study showed when people were given opportunities to share their “pearls of wisdom,” their brains’ reward systems were activated.2 In other words— we’re addicted to sharing information. That’s how it goes. In, out, in, out, in, out. Information comes and goes with no one at the door checking IDs. I’m not suggesting we shut these doors completely, but I think we should be more careful with what we let through. How much information do you consume daily, and how much of that are you actually allowing yourself to process? We will talk more about this in the next chapter, but begin by accepting that, yes, maybe you might be consuming too much. If we need ID checkers at our information door, we need bouncers at our other door—the door to awareness—because what most of us don’t keep open (and sometimes keep sealed with chain and lock) are the gates in which we allow ourselves to feel. Feeling takes awareness. Processing the things we read and learn on an emotional level takes courage and strength. But what I’ve learned, which has been such a revelation, is if we keep the awareness gates closed for too long, with the information gates wide open, the pressure on those doors builds up. Like an angry army ready to attack, the burden can soon become too much. And then one day, often when we least expect it, those doors come crashing in. By understanding awareness hurts and, actually, it’s okay, you put your party suit on and let those gates spring open. You let every visitor know they’re welcome—stress, fear, happiness, joy, pride, anxiety, and more fear —they can all come in. And you let them in because you understand they all come with important information. By paying attention to what worries you, you can look into the issue and hopefully do something about it. By allowing yourself to truly feel happiness and joy, you’ll be much better equipped to deal with whatever comes your way. With a castle filled with visitors from all walks of life, you can run a kingdom built on equality, justice, empowerment, and trust. Trust in yourself and your capability to process information, paired with the ability to use these forces to act on your thoughts and concerns. Without your awareness, gates open; you’re nothing but a passage for information—a “free zone” that stronger powers can take advantage of. But when you learn to have a sensible and steady stream at both doors, you become whole—not just whole, but powerful, trusting, loving, and incredibly strong. “When we compassionately face and let ourselves be transformed by our dark emotions, we become more psychologically regenerative, inwardly rich enough to curb our other riches.” — Jack Adam Weber That’s the liberating truth—awareness hurts and that’s okay. You are much stronger than you think, and by choosing to stay actively aware of what’s going on in the world, you are in control. I want to emphasize the actively because you will be aware regardless (that banging on the door will get hard to ignore). But with your eyes open instead of shut, you can take that information in controlled, bite-sized pieces. You can practice staying aware while keeping your feet steady on the ground. And with that awareness, you can begin to take empowered action. If you don’t do this, if you keep sleepwalking with a pink cloud around your head thinking that it’s the only way to stay optimistic, you’ll soon trip on something you can’t see, and you’ll fall. I fell many times, and it was never fun. As you know, I had tantrums in the car, cried in the shower, and had days when I felt so down that I couldn’t find reasons to leave bed at all. The pink cloud certainly wasn’t working. We know the world is messed up and many things are going in a very wrong direction. We know that species are becoming extinct at an alarming rate, that we’re reaching atmospheric tipping points all over the world, and that greed and mindless consumer habits have created a system where we care more about money and fame than life and death. We know this—I know you know this—so how do we stay aware and still find hope to make a change? We grow our hearts even bigger. That’s the only way. Have you ever had a moment when your heart grew so big, you honestly didn’t know if it would hold or burst? Have you felt so much love, joy, or gratitude you didn’t know what to do with yourself? You may have felt it at your graduation, while celebrating an end of an era with your friends and family there to support you. Or you may have felt it in small, intimate moments with the people you love. It’s that feeling when the world inside you expands, and you start to wonder if you can take it, if your heart can hold this much happiness and love. You think it doesn’t matter what happens next because at least you had this moment. I want you to remember right now that your heart is capable of that love. Your heart can grow so much, in ways you didn’t even think possible. For anyone who’s become a parent (I’m about to learn about this experience and I can’t wait), you may have had this happen to you. Love so strong you didn’t even know you had it in you. I know it’s scary. I know that saying yes to love (no matter what kind) can lead to heartbreak and pain, and yes, the painful truth is that love can hurt. But just like leg muscles grow in pain, so does your heart. Keep giving it more, and it will keep growing bigger, stronger, and more capable of love. In other words, don’t hold back on life. Be here for all of it or you might be missing out on the reasons to actually believe in a better world. However, just because it’s okay for awareness to hurt doesn’t mean you have to keep your gates open to all the pain. You are only human after all, so know your limits. Later, we will talk about controlling your negative news intake, how to deal with what you learn, and how to grow emotional resilience so you can stay aware, yet empowered and motivated to take action. You are made of 70 percent water. The Earth’s surface is made up of 70 percent water. We are water. So who are you not to let your teardrops flow? Let. Yourself. Feel. CHAPTER 38 Awareness Overload Tonight, you decide, is the night you’re finally going to watch that documentary everyone’s talking about. You’ve been putting it off because you’re nervous about how it’ll make you feel, but everyone talking has made you curious—you want to be in the know too. You sit yourself down with a bowl of popcorn and press play. Let’s learn about plastics in our oceans. Soon enough, you find yourself consumed—how are things this bad? As the popcorn shrinks, your awareness grows, and you feel yourself slowly changing. If you were living in oblivion before, you’re not going to be that person anymore. This mindless dumping of our waste has got to come to an end. Ninety minutes later, you go to bed with an aching heart and images of turtles with plastic straws in their bleeding noses. You can’t believe we’ve come to this, and knowing this pains you, but at least you feel empowered, and empowered means you can take action, so you doze off with a new fire burning inside you—things have got to change. The next morning, you wake up with images from last night’s documentary still vivid in your memory. You feel changed, and you’re determined to do what you can to fight this plastic pandemic and bring justice to the oceans. You can’t wait to share what you’ve just learned so when you get to work or school, you talk about it with your colleagues or friends. Do they know how bad things are? And do they realize how much our daily habits are polluting the Earth and killing innocent life all over the planet? Let’s say they do know because they’ve seen the film too, and they actually have more insight than you because they’ve taken some time to look into the issue. And as the conversation goes, you learn it’s not just about you and your daily habits, but about companies choosing to pollute despite environmental threats, and about politics allowing these acts in the first place. The more you talk about it, the more you understand how complex and complicated the issue is, and slowly, your commitment to saving the planet fades. Who are you to make a difference? As such a small fish in this huge ocean of power, who are you to make waves? Before you know it, you hit the wall of awareness overload, and it doesn’t matter what you try because you feel like a useless piece of plastic in the wind, unable to do anything but exist and get stuck on high branches. Slowly, the images of the documentary fade as your normal life begins to take over, and you silently pray someone—an activist group, a bold politician, a company—will do something to end this mess. You’ll hope someone else will do what you can’t. Then you rationalize. You’re just part of the system, and there’s not much you can actually do without the system changing first. Maybe you go on hating yourself for every polluting action, or maybe you don’t, but your inability to act is still there. The awareness overload has gotten the best of you. This is what I call the route to awareness overload. Maybe you’ve been here before. Maybe you’ve been here many times. Or maybe you haven’t found yourself here quite yet. It doesn’t matter. Chances are you will end up here in the future, and when you do, it’s important to understand why you’re here. First of all, as discussed previously, there is way too much information out there for us to keep up with. With so much negative information at our fingertips, who doesn’t get overwhelmed? Recognize it is a normal, very human reaction. Second, companies in power who continue knowingly and willingly to pollute the earth want us to feel overwhelmed. If we are, they can continue doing what they’re doing without interference. If you feel we can’t do anything, they will happily play the inertia card and confirm your feelings. For example, it’s been put on us—the consumer—to responsibly recycle packaging and products, although most of those products aren’t even actually recyclable in the first place. Ludicrous? Yes. Yet this is how the world works. If a product exists that can’t be recycled or harmlessly returned to the Earth, is it the company’s fault for producing it, or the consumer’s for buying it? You get my point. Unfortunately, that is the reality with many things in our world today, so it’s important we don’t get stuck in the overload phase for too long. Although giants are out there (companies with lots of money and power) who are on the other team, we can still win. As consumers and citizens, we have so much more power than we think, and the sooner we can get out of the paralyzing overload phase, the better. Begin by giving yourself a break. Traveling the route to awareness overload is both common and normal, and we all do it from time to time— sustainability newbies and seasoned climate scientists alike. What’s important is to ensure we don’t get stuck there, that we start to take small steps out of overload and into empowered action because it is the only way we will ever actually make a change. Yes, systems need to change, companies need to step up and take responsibility, and governments need to show they care more about life and the future of our planet than money. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have a part to play. As a citizen, you are the system, and every day, you make many, many choices that can build up to the changes you wish to see. As a consumer, you can vote with your dollars and support companies with missions you believe in. As a citizen, you can get involved in local politics and show your elected officials what you believe in. You can call in and share your support for ongoing bills (something I highly recommend doing because it’s so empowering) and you can also show up to public meetings and hearings. Gather some friends and family and your influence can suddenly become substantial. And finally, as an activist, you can sign petitions (they matter); show up for a beach, park, stream, or road cleanup; help plant trees; join a community garden; or demonstrate against polluting activities in your area, to name a few. In other words, never underestimate your power to make a change. Awareness isn’t the issue. Awareness devoid of action is. This means continuing to shed light and spark awareness isn’t going to do much unless we quickly move on to the next step—doing something. By slowly integrating yourself into powerful, positive action—no matter how small— you keep clear of overload, remain empowered and optimistic, and, ultimately, provide hope for others too. CHAPTER 39 Climate Anxiety “Perhaps the way to being the revolution is to stand up for your depression!” — Cultural Psychologist James Hillman It was 2006, and Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth had just come out. I remember watching it a second time with my parents. I saw it in school first, then again at home, and as the credits rolled down the screen, I remember thinking, “The world is about to change.” I was terrified by the findings, but grateful we knew what was going on. Luckily, we had a chance to act. Keep in mind I was only fifteen and my understanding of the world was still forming. Therefore, I honestly thought the whole world would come together in a big room (like I’d seen things happen in the movies) and make decisions on how to save ourselves from this human-made disaster. I was expecting to read about it in the newspaper every day and to talk about it in school between sessions. With this much change ahead, I expected nothing short of a worldwide crisis, and surely nothing would go by unnoticed or unsaid. Young and naive, I didn’t understand the world was full of sharks who would do everything in their power to deny and spread false information about climate change so they could continue to make money. I also didn’t understand that an undertaking like redesigning the world to fight climate change would take years, if not decades, or that we needed a whole lot of people in power to find the courage to do the right thing. In fact, I didn’t understand much of any of this, and the only thing that soon became clear to me was none of what I thought would happen, would happen. No headlines, no global oval table crisis meetings, and no war-like crisis mode were on the horizon. It was just….more of the same. School went on as usual. My parents’ lives went on as usual, and the world kept spinning with the same conversations we’ve always had. Nothing changed. The only difference was I knew. I tried doing what the rest of the planet seemed to be doing. I tried living a normal life and hoped someone in power was working on a plan. As a fifteen-year-old, I didn’t think I had any power to do anything anyway, so I did what I thought was the right thing—I focused on school, grades, parties, and friends. I returned to being a typical teenager and tried to ignore climate change as much as possible; the thought of it was simply too hard to handle. I didn’t know then that by ignoring my fears, I started a fifteen-year bout of climate anxiety. Climate anxiety is no joke. Having dealt with it for so long, I know this for certain. As I said, it caused rage, sobs, and tons of frustration, but it also grew deeper than all that. When I began healing myself in my late twenties, I recognized even the eating disorder and body dysmorphia I had struggled with my entire young adult life were rooted in climate anxiety. Since I couldn’t control the world or all the horrible things going on, I needed something I could control, something to tie my sanity to that I was able to manage. I realized my calorie-mania, frantic exercising, and constant calculating of my food-and-exercise balance was my way of staying in control. If I could ensure I didn’t gain any fat, I was in control, and I needed that. I desperately needed that control. It took me years to heal because I frankly didn’t know I was dealing with climate anxiety, nor did I have any idea what it was. When I was a teenager, no one was talking about this, and I didn’t think I had anywhere to turn for help. I didn’t know I should be looking for help. That climate anxiety is something many are aware of today is both great and concerning. It means those suffering from it can get help, but it also means it’s become so common that it’s a topic worth talking about. Pennsylvania State University psychology professor Janet Smith describes climate anxiety as, “Something people feel more and more when they get closer to an anti-goal, meaning a negative result, like the destruction of the planet.”3 In other words, we experience anxiety when we feel like we lack control. When it comes to climate change, I think we can agree that’s how most of us feel. If you are aware of climate change, chances are you’re suffering from some degree of anxiety, maybe without even knowing it. The stages of climate anxiety can vary from “concerned” to “traumatized,” where it can go as far as questioning your reasons for staying alive. If you are at this stage, or if you find yourself losing sleep or focus due to climate stress, seek help. I’m sharing helpful ways of working through your anxiety and growing through your emotions, but I am not a health practitioner, so if you need medical attention, please seek it. No matter where you are on the spectrum, understand that feeling anxious about climate change is normal. In fact, as sad as it is to say, 73 percent of Americans agree that climate change is probably or definitely affecting their mental health.4 Not only is the increasing epidemic of climate anxiety bad for our overall wellbeing, but it’s taking a toll on our important work. As Smith explains, “Anxious people tend to shut down and not engage.” Although what we really need is to feel empowered and inspired to take action, the opposite is happening. Not only is the fear of climate change digging us deeper into the hole of despair, but it’s also keeping us stuck there. Therefore, it is important we check in with ourselves (preferably regularly) to see how we are feeling. If you are worried or feel fear or anger, allow yourself to tap into these feelings. Remember ignorance is not always bliss and that by remaining aware, you can work through your emotions and let them empower you instead of allowing them to be the gateway to despair. At the end of this chapter, I will share some tips I’ve learned (for myself and from real experts in the field) that can help you with whatever climate anxiety you might have. Diﬀerence Between Climate Anxiety and Eco-Grief Climate anxiety is what you suffer from when you are worried about climate change and the many scary scenarios this crisis could lead to. If you’re a parent, you might be worried about your kids’ future. If you’re a teenager, you might very well be worried about your own. The reasons for climate anxiety can be many, and they are often attached to personal threats to your own wellbeing. Since the future is so uncertain due to this threat, the reasons to worry are endless, but more often than not, they are tied to our own fears. Eco-grief is not quite the same, although the two are closely linked, and many who suffer from one, suffer from both. Eco-grief simply means you mourn the loss of our natural world. In What We Think About When We Try Not to Think About Global Warming, Per Espen Stoknes explains we have three main sets of values: egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric. Egoistic values are those focused on personal achievements, like social power, wealth, and personal success. Altruistic values make us care about other people and the bigger community, the kinds of values that make us good citizens. Finally, biospheric values focus on the health of beings like plants, animals, trees, mountains, and other ecosystems—it’s about caring for the living world. Stoknes further explains we all have each of these values; however, they are weighted differently from person to person. Research confirms the more connected one is to nature, the stronger their biospheric values are. This means if you spent a great deal of time in nature as a child (or later as an adult), you feel a connection to nature. To you, nature is more than just a place to go from time to time. You care for nature as if it were a sibling or friend. You understand nature is part of you, as it is part of all of us, and coming to that realization can be the most healing feeling in the world. But it can also be extremely devastating when you connect the dots and understand that, gulp, we’re all dying. Ecocide is real, and when Mother Earth is hurting, so are we. Not only do we rely on ecosystems for our world to function, which makes the rapid decline of species around the world even more heartbreaking, but we feel this loss on a spiritual level too.5 If you can relate to this, if you feel like the loss of nature pains you gravely, embrace that about yourself—it means you’re deeply connected. You just have to learn how to use it as your strength and ensure we save whatever we still have left. Since you likely have all these values—egoistic, altruistic, biospheric— there’s a great chance you suffer climate depression to some degree, even if you’re not aware of it. I recommend doing the journaling exercise below so you can gain a better understanding of your current emotional resilience. One more thing—don’t fear grief. We tend to have a strained relationship with grief like grieving is something we do behind closed doors when no one is watching so we can appear strong when we step back into the world again. But what if grief doesn’t make us weaker, but stronger? What if it’s the missing piece that will enable us to actually do something about this crisis we’re in? “There’s a hidden secret in the despair paradox. Going down the depths of despair can also bring healing.… The more we let death —even the threats of extinction—into our souls, the more we can appreciate the current vibrant vitality of life in its many forms. And we may even be transformed by it.” — Per Epsen Stoknes CHAPTER 40 Activate Healing My climate optimist awakening saved me in many ways. It was when I recognized I had to start taking serious care of myself or none of my work would matter. If I’m not strong, how can I help the world?",121818
Barbara Kingsolver,1,"Garnett Walker III, to ask, “Who cares if one species is lost?” The extinction of one kind of tree wreaked pure havoc on the folks all through these mountains—your own family more than any other. Suppose some city Yank said to you, “Well, sir, the American chestnut was just one tree—why, the woods are full of trees!” You’d get so mad you’d spit. It would take you a day and a night to try and explain why the chestnut was a tree unlike any other, that held a purpose in our world that nothing else can replace. Well sir, the loss of one kind of salamander would be a tragedy on the same order to some other creature that was depending on it. It wouldn’t be you this time, but I assume you care about all tragedies, not just the ones that affect the Walker fortunes. Do you recall how they mentioned in the paper last year about all the mussel shells in our river going extinct? Well, Mr. Walker, now the mailman tells me he saw on a nature show that every kind of mussel has to live 215 { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } part of its little life as a parasite on the gills of a different kind of minnow. If the right minnow isn’t there at the right time, well, sir, that’s the end of the story! Everything alive is connected to every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don’t see can help you plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and that’s the moral of the story. There’s even a thing called the Volterra principle that I read about in my orcharding journal, which is all about how insecticide spraying actually drives up the numbers of the bugs you’re trying to kill. Oh, it’s an aggravation and a marvel. The world is a grand sight more complicated than we like to let on. Just think: if someone had shown you a little old seedling tree potted in a handful of dirt coming in on a ship from Asia all those years ago, asked you to peek into it, and remarked, “These piddly little strands of fungus will knock down a million majestic chestnut trees, starve out thousands of righteous mountain folk, and leave Garnett Walker a bitter old man,” would you have laughed? If God gave Man all the creatures of this earth to use for his own ends, he also counseled that gluttony is a sin—and he did say, flat out, “Thou shalt not kill.” He didn’t tell us to go ahead and murder every beetle or caterpillar that wants to eat what we eat (and, by the way, other insects that pollinate what we eat). He did not mean for us to satisfy our every whim for any food, in every season, by tearing down forest to make way for field, ripping up field to make way for beast, and transporting everything we can think of to places it doesn’t belong. To our dominion over the earth, Mr. Walker, we owe our thanks for the chestnut blight. Our thanks for kudzu, honeysuckle, and the Japanese beetle also. I think that’s all God’s little joke on us for getting too big for our britches. We love to declare that God made us in his image, but even so, he’s three 216 { P r o d i g a l S u m m e r } billion years old and we’re just babies. I know your opinion of teenagers, Mr. Walker; just bear in mind that to God, you and I are much younger, even, than that. We’re that foolish, to think we know how to rule the world. I’m partial to the passage from Genesis you quoted, but I wonder if you really understand it. God gave us every herbbearing seed, it says, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree-yielding seed. He gave us the mystery of a world that can re-create itself again and again. To you the fruit shall be food, he’s saying, but just remember, to the tree it’s a child. “And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat.” He’s looking out for the salamanders there, you see? Reminding us that there’s life in them, too, and that even weeds and pond algae are sacred because they’re salamander food. You’re a religious man, Mr. Walker. Seems to me you’d think twice about spraying Roundup all over God’s hard work. Never mind. We all have our peeves. Myself, I hate goats (as you well know), and I sorely despise snapping turtles. I’m sure God loves them as much as he loves you or me, but I’ve got new baby ducklings on my pond, and an evil old turtle in there is gobbling them down like the troll under the bridge. I can’t stand it. There was one duckling I loved best, white with a brown wing (I named him Saddle Shoe), and yesterday while I stood and watched, that turtle came up right underneath and yanked down poor Shoe as he flapped and wailed for Mama. I bawled like a baby. I’d shoot that old S-O-B in the head if I had a gun and the heart to use it, so help me! But I have neither, and God knows that is surely for the best. Yours very sincerely, Nannie Land Rawley 217 { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } P.S. I had to rack my brain, but yes, I recall my conversation in the hardware. I was telling a tale on myself: I’m not used to the get-up-and-go hydrostat transmission they put in the new Snappers, compared to the old geared ones. Marshall claims he sold me a small, polite little mower, but I say it’s a monster with a death wish. I left it running in the front yard one day while I went in to get a drink of water, and when I came back it was gone! I called Timmy Boyer to report it stolen! The poor man had to walk up to my porch with hat in hand and explain to me as how he’d found my mower in a compromising position a hundred yards downhill from where I left it. Evidently while I was inside, my Snapper took a wild hair and decided to fling itself headfirst into Egg Creek. Mr. Walker, I’ve always found people love you best if you can laugh at your own foolish misfortunes and keep mum about everyone else’s. Well, thought Garnett. For goodness’sakes. It was a lot to take in at once. He felt a moment’s relief about the whole snapper incident and an iota of sympathy for the woman’s poor ducklings (oh, Saddle Shoe!), but only an iota, before his blood pressure started to rise. The longer he stared at the letter, flipping backward through its several pages, the more its true meaning began to reveal itself to him among the flimflam phrases of her mock friendliness. Bitter old man indeed! He forgot the pie completely—would not remember it, in fact, until a day and a half later (at which time he would sample it tentatively and find it still edible). That pie was the furthest thing from his mind as he stomped to his desk and tore a blank sheet from one of his chestnut notebooks. Without a second thought to appearances, for this was no time to stand on ceremony, he plucked a black ballpoint pen out of his pen-and-pencil cup and applied it so hard to the page that its line wavered and skipped like a terrified heart. “Dear Miss Rawley,” he scrawled, 218 { P r o d i g a l S u m m e r } I am weary of your grabbing every opportunity as a pulpit for your absurd views on modern agriculture!! If you can prove to me your so-called Voltaire principal, i.e. spraying pesticide is good for the health of insects, then by all means I will drink a quart of malathion, pronto!! Furthermore, what is this business about God being three billion years old? God is ageless; the earth and its inhabitants were created in 4300 B.C., as can be proved by extrapolating backward from present population to the time of the first two people, Adam and Eve. You were unaware of this scientific formulation, probably, or were perhaps making a veiled reference to Evolutionary Theory. Because if the latter, your words fall on ears too wise for that old scam. I am a scholar of Creation Science, and suggest you think about a thing or two, i.e. who but an Intelligent, Beautiful Creator could have created a world filled with beauty and intelligence? How could Random Chance (i.e. “evolution”) have created lifeforms so vastly complex as those that fill our world? I realize you’re no scientist, Miss Rawley, but I could explain to you the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that all natural things move from order to chaos, quite the opposite of what the evolutionists claim. I could go much further than this, though I am fighting the inclination to wash my hands of you altogether and let you cast your own soul on the brimstone as you seem determined to do, and let you face in the jaws of Satan the same fate suffered by your precious duckling. Hah! thought Garnett, rather proud of his dramatic twist of the knife and thinking he ought to end right there. “But no,” he wrote, unable to stop himself, I shall be a good neighbor and send you these thoughts which should be enough for you and your bra-burning 219 { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } Unitarian friends to ponder, I dare say, for many days to come. Truly, Garnett S. Walker III p.s. I am not a bitter old man. Garnett carefully affixed not one but two stamps to the envelope to prove his point (he wasn’t sure exactly what point, but he trusted his instincts) and licked its seal shut before he could give himself a chance at failed nerve or courage. Politeness be hanged. This was no longer simply a matter of pride. Garnett Walker was now a Soldier of God on the way to his mailbox, marching as to war. 220 { 15} Moth Love front lawn looked like a bolt of deep-green velvet F rom where Lusa stood at her upstairs window, the with just a few moth-eaten patches where the reddish ground showed through. Jewel and Emaline were setting up the lawn chairs while Emaline’s husband, Frank, and Mary Edna’s Herb carried the big walnut dining table outside. Lusa had invited the whole family for the Fourth of July, claiming she needed to make ice cream out of a month’s worth of leftover cream sitting in her icebox. Maybe it was just pity, but they’d all agreed to come— even Mary Edna’s son and his wife from Leesport, whom she’d met only at the funeral. Mary Edna had arrived an hour early with a plate of deviled eggs in each hand (Salmonella waiting to happen, Lusa thought but did not say). Seeing the front hallway suddenly occupied by the Menacing Eldest in a burnt-orange pantsuit and sensible shoes had sent Lusa into a panic; she’d called out some instructions and flown { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } upstairs on the pretense of finding a tablecloth. But of course Mary Edna would know that the tablecloths were in the cherry armoire in the parlor. Right now, in fact, she was outside sailing one of her mother’s linens over the table while the men hunkered down near the chicken house with their backs to her, stabbing beers into a tub of ice and opening up long-necked bottles of something homemade. Hannie-Mavis was trying to organize the kids into a labor pool for cranking the ice cream, but at the moment they were circling her like a swarm of bees threatening their queen with mutiny. Lusa stood with one hand on the back of the green brocade chair and looked down on all her in-laws from above, pondering their resemblance to the clucking, parti-colored flock of chickens that was usually scattered out over her yard. The hens had scrammed early to their roosts to avoid this onslaught of relatives. Lusa smiled a small, sad smile, wishing she could watch the whole evening from this window. Finally they were all here, conceding to be her guests. And she didn’t have the nerve to go downstairs. She sighed and shut the window. It had rained earlier. The air had the fetid smell of mushrooms releasing their spores into the damp air. It was evening, though, so the men would be shooting off their fireworks soon, tinting the air blue with that acrid smoke. Having a program would help the evening go by. She glanced in the dresser mirror and ran a hand through her strawberry mane, feeling miserable. Her jeans fit too well, the black knit shirt was too lowcut, her hair was too red—the widow Jezebel. She’d chosen the black top for a drab effect, but it was no small task to look dowdy next to Mary Edna in her waistless polyester pantsuit, or HannieMavis in a red striped top, star-spangled shorts, gold mules, and blue eyeliner. Lusa pointed her feet toward the stairs and made them go. It time, it’s time, too late to change now. A year too late. She was right about the fireworks; there was already a movement afoot to begin. Hannie-Mavis’s Joel and Big Rickie were peering into a series of brown paper bags they’d set out in a row, arguing about some aspect of the scheme. Lusa was grateful for the 222 { P r o d i g a l S u m m e r } rain—she’d been genuinely afraid they’d burn down her barn, and not brave enough to declare a ban on the fireworks (they were a tradition). But May and June had dumped such rain on Zebulon County that the air itself could smother a flame. Bullfrogs had wandered up out of the duck pond and carelessly laid their jellied masses of eggs in the grass, apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim through the lawn like little sperms. Fierce snapping turtles no longer confined themselves to the ponds but wandered the lanes like highwaymen. In all her life Lusa had never seen such an oversexed, muggy summer. Just breathing was a torrid proposition. “Hey, guys,” she called to Joel and Big Rickie, who nodded at her, smiling broadly like schoolboys. They were thrilled about this picnic. Lois the Loud, meanwhile, sat in a folding chair near the food table, chain-smoking and posting a stream of complaints about how much they’d spent on the fireworks. “One hundred and eighty-one dollars,” she boomed in a voice deepened by decades of cigarettes. Mary Edna stood three feet away, ignoring her and scowling at the food table. When Lois spied Lusa coming out of the house, she perked up at the potential of a new audience. “A hundred and eighty-one dollars!” she called out to Lusa. “That’s what these little boys spent on their little show for tonight, did you ever hear the like?” Lusa had already heard it all from upstairs, but she pretended to be dismayed. “Good grief. Did they drive all the way to China, or what?” she said, walking over toward Lois. She was relieved to see that Lois was in the Jezebel camp, too, dressed in jeans and a western-style shirt unsnapped a tad too far. “Naw,” Lois said, “they went over to Crazy Harry’s down there off the interstate.” As far as Lusa could tell, the entire border of the state of Tennessee was ringed with shacks advertising cheap fireworks. It had to do with their being legal on one side of the line and not the other, but she wasn’t sure which was which. 223 { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } “I should have gone with them,” Lois droned on in her deep, cracked voice. “Or sent Little Rickie and the girls along to keep an eye on them. I didn’t think two grown men would act like kids in a candy store.” She examined the ends of her hair, which she wore long and dyed coal black—not flatteringly, in Lusa’s opinion, since Lois was fair and blue-eyed like Cole, and a little long in the tooth for the straight, dyed look. But maybe having Indian-black hair like her husband and children made her feel like she belonged to them. Who knew? Mary Edna was fussing tediously with a piece of aluminum foil over a sheet cake. She was a vision in her orange polyester, which seemed itself a heat source in this muggy night; the outfit gave Lusa an odd, uncomfortable sensation that Mary Edna’s physical presence would spoil the food. Mary Edna turned around suddenly, as if reading Lusa’s thoughts, but it was Lois she snapped at: “Oh, hush your bellyaching, Lois, they do it ever year. If you’re not used to it by now, you never will be.” Lusa winced, but Lois was utterly unfazed. She craned her head sideways toward Mary Edna, flicking ash in the grass. “Why sure, go ahead and talk. Your husband wouldn’t go spend a week’s grocery money on cherry bombs and Martian Candles and stuff.” “I’d ruther him do that than what he’s up to right now, down there poking his nose in the bottles. What kind of hooch have they got down there?” “Lord, honey, Frank’s done made that elderberry wine. You’d think he’d get over that little chemistry project, or Emaline would dump it down the drain, one.” “Oh, it’s that business.” “He claims it’s a pure wonderful product and maybe he’ll sell it one of these days.” Lois rolled her eyes. Mary Edna touched her bluish, tightly coiffed hair and stared at the men with narrow eyes. “I wouldn’t know. You ask me, I’d have to agree with the good Lord. All of it bites as the serpent.” 224 { P r o d i g a l S u m m e r } Lois snorted, breathing smoke out her nose like a dragon. “After the second bottle of that stuff, turpentine’d taste pure wonderful, I expect.” Lusa watched the sisters volley, surprised that they could be as mean about their own husbands and each other’s as they’d ever been toward her. Cole had always insisted that she took his family too personally. She’d never had brothers or sisters of her own, only parents who said “please” and “thank you” to each other and to the child they’d produced late in life and never quite known how to handle. Maybe Cole had been right. She’d never experienced rough-and-tumble, the sharper edges of family love. She walked down toward the chicken house, deciding to investigate whatever it was that was biting these men as the serpent. They were engaged in the kind of cheerful, energetic argument that tends to happen when all present are agreed and the enemy is absent. Farm policy and government stupidity, most likely. But maybe not. “Blevins would lie, though,” Herb was saying. “He’d lie quicker than a dog can lick a plate.” “Howdy, gentlemen,” she called from a decent distance as she approached, just in case they were about to say something they wouldn’t want her to hear. It embarrassed them to death if they let slip even so much as a “hell” or “damn” in her presence. “Hey there, Miz Widener,” Big Rickie called to her. “I have a crow to pick with you!” His friendliness caught her off guard. This crow didn’t seem very threatening. “What is it now, those cows I sold you and Joel? Did they all run off already? I warned you they were fence jumpers.” “No ma’am, them cattle are behaving just fine, thank you. But now we leased them cattle, a percentage on the calves, let’s don’t forget. We don’t owe you unless they all get busy and get theirselves in the family way this winter.” “I recall the terms, and I gave those girls their instructions.” Lusa smiled. Rickie and Joel had made her a good deal, and she knew it. 225 { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } “No, now, our contention is with your antitobacco policy.” “My what? Oh, I see. You’ve got me chalked up as the enemy of the small farmer.” Rickie hid his cigarette quickly behind his back. Herb, Joel, Frank, and Herb’s son all followed suit. “No ma’am,” Big Rickie said. “We’ve got you chalked up with Miss Butcher, our tenthgrade shop teacher. She used to throw screwdrivers at us when she caught us smoking.” “A woman, you had for a shop teacher? A Miss Butcher? I can’t believe that.” “God’s honest truth,” Frank said. “I had her, Rickie and Joel had her, and Herb’s boy here did, too. By the time she retired she was somewheres around a hundred years old, and missing three fingers.” “She should live to a hundred and twenty,” Lusa said. “Look at you. Despite her years of trial, you’re all still smoking like chimneys. Where’s my screwdriver?” They ducked their heads like little boys. Lusa felt amazed to be the center of their attention. These men had never fully let her in on a conversation before. Possibly it was the elderberry wine, which Frank was now urging her to sample. He’d put it up in beer bottles, so it was hard to tell who was drinking what. “Wow,” she said, after a taste. It was dry and strong, almost like brandy. “Good,” she added, nodding, since they seemed very interested in her opinion. “Although I hear it bites as the serpent.” They exploded at that, all of them, even Herb. Lusa flushed a little, pleased to have earned this amity but also surprised to find herself allying with these men against their women. Or maybe it was just Mary Edna. There seemed to be resentment throughout the ranks on the Mary Edna score. “So, Mr. Big Rickie. What’s this crow you have to pick with me, really?” “Them goats up ’air in your back pasture. Now I see why you 226 { P r o d i g a l S u m m e r } had Joel and me clear out all your cattle: to make way for the goats. I know what you got ’em for, too.” “You do?” She felt a slight panic, for no reason. Had Little Rickie shared her plan? Would it really matter if he had? “Yep.” Big Rickie had a twinkle in his eye. “OK, why did I get those goats?” “To make me look bad. They’ll eat down all the thistles and rose briars out of your hayfield neat as pickle. And see, now, a man drives by, he’ll look on the other side of the fence and say, ‘Well, sir, that old Big Rickie Bowling, his hay’s nothing but a mess of briars. I wouldn’t buy that hay for two cents.’” “That’s exactly why I got goats, to wreck your hay trade. I couldn’t stand to sit here and watch you get rich selling hay.” “Lord, Rickie,” Joel said, “woman’s going to ruin you. You’d just as well get out of farming altogether, with her running the competition.” Were they making fun of her now? But this was how they spoke to each other, too—in a complicated mix of rue, ridicule, and respect that she was just beginning to grasp. They were also appreciating her figure rather frankly, especially Big Rickie and Herb’s son from Leesport, whatever his name was. Lusa pulled at her shirt, wondering if her nipples showed through somehow. She racked her brain for the son’s name, which she couldn’t have guessed if her life depended on it. She kept hoping he would reintroduce himself, but instead he handed her a second bottle of Serpent, as they were now calling their drink. Had she downed the first one so fast? And why did Rickie keep smiling at her? He was a handful—she’d never imagined this side of him. She could see why Lois would want to keep her hair young and her eye peeled. “Is ’at there barn made of chestnut?” Herb’s nameless boy was asking her now. “You’re asking me? ” “Your barn, ain’t it?” 227 { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } She was startled by this turn in the conversation that had now, suddenly, given her authority over her barn. Their wives wouldn’t even acknowledge Lusa’s ownership of her kitchen. But of course, these men were in-laws, too; they hadn’t grown up in these buildings any more than Lusa had. She’d never really thought of this— they weren’t Wideners, either. “Yeah, I think it is chestnut,” she said. She pointed at the joinery under the peak of the gable end. “You see how the roof got raised up at some point? That was more recent, and I think they used oak. It’s not weathering as well. All the rafters need to be replaced.” Herb whistled. “That’s going to cost you.” “Tell me,” she said. “If you hear of anybody who likes to replace barn roofs, tell him you know a lady who’s looking to make him rich.” “You ought to have him build you a gabazo up there on your hill, while he’s at it,” said Frank. “So you could set up there in it and watch your goats.” “I know a man that had two gabazos,” Rickie said. “But they died.” “Rickie Bowling, you’re a damn fool.” They all stood silent for a moment in the early-evening light, studying the barn with its many seams of age and repair. From the depths of the chicken house behind them came the low, worldweary moan of a hen slowly accomplishing an egg. In the ambient air the choir of summer insects was tuning up its infinite clicks and trills. By nightfall they’d be deafening, loud enough to drown out the fireworks. But for now Lusa and the men could still hear the constant voice of Lois, who had flagged down Hannie-Mavis and was now bending her ear about the price of gunpowder. “I’m a damn fool,” Rickie said solemnly, “what spent a hundred dollars on fireworks, and won’t hear the end of it till Christmas.” “I heard it was a hundred and eighty-one dollars and twelve cents,” Lusa said. “Approximately.” 228 { P r o d i g a l S u m m e r } “No, now, the eighty-one dollars and twelve cents, that was Joel.” “Come on,” Joel said, suddenly excited. “Let’s go shoot.” “Hold your horses, Mr. Sexton. We can’t start till it gets good and dark.” But Joel was already walking back uphill. They all watched him go, observing as his path intersected with that of the starred-and-striped Hannie-Mavis, who had broken free of Lois and was headed in her husband’s direction carrying a hot dog on a bun. Lusa started to make a remark about her outfit also looking better in the dark, but she thought better of it as Hannie-Mavis stood on tiptoe in her little gold shoes, letting Joel give her a kiss before he took the hot dog from her. There was such a wealth of simple fondness in his hand as it touched her back, in her stretched calves and her head turned to receive his kiss. A vast loneliness crept over Lusa. She needed Cole to negotiate this family. With him it had made sense. Or could have, maybe, eventually. Joel began poking into the paper bags, holding the hot dog high in his other hand as he bent over. Rickie seemed nervous about letting him do it alone. “I hate to leave such pleasant company,” he said, making a courtly bow and giving Lusa a look in the eye that shocked her with suggestion. “But I have to go keep an eye on my brother-in-law. He is not to be trusted.” “I don’t think you are, either,” she said. He winked. “I believe you may be right.” Lusa turned her face away to hide a blush, pretending to look uphill toward the food table. She felt incensed—here she was not six weeks a widow, and her brother-in-law was flirting. Although he may have just been trying to cheer her, and the alcohol muddled everything, of course. Just for a minute, she herself had forgotten to be sad. She felt guilty and hopeful both, realizing that beyond these numb days lay an opposite shore where physical pleasure might someday surprise her with its sharp touch. Where she would see colors again. “Gentlemen. I’d better go act like a decent hostess and see if 229 { B A R B A R A K I N G S O L V E R } we’re going to have any ice cream,” she said. Frank reached out to snag the empty bottle out of her left hand and press a full one into it. “We are sinking deep in sin,” she sang quietly as she walked past Mary Edna with a Serpent in each hand, heading down",154368

OceanofPDF.com Glacial Erratics There are people who, when they go, shift the meaning of words we use each day. Down goes Frazier, we used to joke, when sleep knocked our daughter out. Now Frazier’s dead, and Megan’s mom is dying of the same cancer. On the phone last night, Megan was a baby. So many new words she needed to say, but no better way to speak than by crying. A wrack of grief we used to say, meaning shipwreck, souls sunk, lost fortune, meaning ruin. Though wrack can also mean seaweed, vegetation, can mean what grows up from what has fallen. A whale fall can support life for over seven decades. The grotesque and beautiful blooming o a mortal behemoth. Bone-rooted worms waving like marsh grasses. Hag sh, all saw-mouth and mucous. Brittle stars. When she got her words again, Megan said the worst of it was that her mother was still driving her crazy. I want to kill her, said Megan. Does she always have to be so controlling? The morning she chose to join us, my daughter pushed against me. My whole body, becoming a mother, squeezed, trying to help push her along. And what could she do but push against me again? Down goes Frazier, we joked because she fought so hard to be alive she hated ever to leave us. Once, my whole body, becoming a mourner, had to push my girl out, to let her go. Like this we’ll be pushing each other, until one of us is nally done. OceanofPDF.com Conspiracy to breathe together Last week, a woman smiled at my daughter and I wondered if she might have been the sort of girl my mother says spat on my aunt when they were children in Virginia all those acts and laws ago. Half the time I can’t tell my experiences apart from the ghosts’. A shirt my mother gave me settles into my chest. I should say onto my chest, but I am self conscious— the way the men watch me while I move toward them makes my heart trip and slide and threaten to bruise so that, inside my chest, I feel the pressure of her body, her mother’s breasts, her mother’s mother’s big, loving bounty. I wear my daughter the way women other places are taught to wear their young. Sometimes, when people smile, I wonder if they think I am being quaintly primitive. The cloth I wrap her in is brightly patterned, African, and the baby’s hair manes her alert head in such a way she has often been compared to an animal. There is a stroller in the garage, but I don’t want to be taken as my own child’s nanny. (Half the time I know my fears are mine alone.) At my shower, a Cameroonian woman helped me practice putting a toy baby on my back. I stood in the middle of a circle of women, stooped over and fumbling with the cloth. Curious George was the only doll on hand, so the white women looked away afraid I would hurt my baby while the black women looked away and thought about not thinking about monkeys. There is so much time in the world. How many ways can it be divided? I walk every day with my daughter and wonder what is happening in other people’s minds. Half the time I am lled with terror. Half the time I am full of myself. The baby is sleeping on my back again. When I stand still, I can feel her breathing. But when I start to move, I lose her in the rhythms of my tread.

No lions, no tigers, no bears. Penguin eggs and penguin chicks are always at the mercy of skua and disaster, but even from the leopard seal and orca the land hauled adult penguin is safe. I am trying to write about penguins, about predatorless terrains. I am trying to write about joy and a kind of cold beauty, but grief won’t stay away. Grief will ride in on the smallest of bodies, a tick on a cormorant’s wing. If the winter isn’t cold enough to kill it, that tick will embed itself in a penguin’s neck, the back of her head, anywhere the penguin can not reach, and because she has no way to tell anyone and because, even if she could convey her agony, there would be no way for her fellow birds to help, she will itch for awhile, swell for awhile, then abandon her nest for the water’s relief. She will run and slide and dive into danger. Her eggs will die and her chicks will die and she may die as well. I am trying to write about predatorless terrains, but grief will ride in on the smallest of bodies, a tick on a cormorant’s wing. I try to write everything down, because I know it would be easier to forget and I want to avoid the comforts of suppression. Scouring journals for my notes about seabird ticks and their toll on Antarctic penguin populations, I nd a di erent set of notes. I’d written, The only time I really talked to you was in your Trenton kitchen. What I meant was that was the only time I ever saw you genuinely smile. The baby needed food, and you, just back from pushing his stroller on a long walk during which you and he both watched the morning sun shine on the faded splendor of those Trenton streets, were boiling a hot dog for your only son, and smiling. There are things I do not want to say, I said in my journal. Except the not saying won’t return anything you love. The boy is dead. The boy’s mother is dead. I was trying to write about beauty, but grief won’t stay away. I was trying to write about babies and birthdays and birds. I was trying to write about joy. OceanofPDF.com There are these moments of permission Between raindrops, space, certainly, but we call it all rain. I hang in the undrenched intervals, while Callie is sleeping, my old self necessary and imperceptible as air. OceanofPDF.com Because it looked hotter that way we let our hair down. It wasn’t so much that we worried about what people thought or about keeping it real but that we knew this was our moment. We knew we’d blow our cool sooner or later. Probably sooner. Probably even before we got too far out of Westmont High and had kids of our own who left home wearing clothes we didn’t think belonged in school. Like Mrs. C., whose nearly unrecognizably pretty senior photo we passed every day on the way to Gym, we’d get old. Or like Mr. Lurk who told us all the time how it’s never too late to throw a Hail Mary like he did his junior year and how we could win everything for the team and hear the band strike up a tune so the cheer squad could sing our name, too. Straight out of a Hallmark movie, Mr. Lurk’s hero turned teacher story. We had heard it a million times. Sometimes he’d ask us to sing with him, T-O-N-Y-L-U-R-K Tony Tony Lurk Lurk Lurk! Sin ironia, con sentimiento, por favor, and then we would get back to our Spanish lessons, opening our thin textbooks, until the bell rang and we went on to the cotton gin in History. Really, this had nothing to do with being cool. We only wanted to have a moment to ourselves, a moment before Jazz Band and after Gym when we could look in the mirror and like it. June and Ti any and Janet all told me I looked pretty. We took turns saying nice things, though we might just as likely say, Die and go to hell. Beauty or hell. No di erence. The bell would ring soon.

We knocked her down. She was lovely waisted as she fell, and she spun down like a maple pod, two arms stretched from the hard center. This is what we wanted because we were afraid. Ding dong, we sang. Ding dong. But she was not yet dead, and so we sang no further. “Why,” the young ones asked, “why.” And, “Why!” and, “Why?” We didn’t immediately answer. For a moment, anyway, we’d forgotten ourselves watching, as we had so long, her downward spiral, but one of us nally spoke, and the rest corroborated his story. The fact, we’ll admit, is we were disturbed by the pleasure she took from our men. At the market, we watched her, she had no shame. Snatched Stan Samson’s eye right along —and he was not alone, we knew— with the optic nerve and, still smiling, of course—imagine the pleasure in that pretty package: brown eye, in her purse now, the nerve —sauntered on, plucky as you will. She drank, we supposed, sangria*, by the bucket, and all the eyes were on her— some in her pocket, some in her purse, some wrapped in a hanky and stu ed down her shirt— all the eyes were on her when she cocked her head and wet her lips and drank. (Note: We say it’s bleeding.) Awful to think she enjoyed it so much, so don’t ask why, we told the young ones. They are watching now and asking no longer why.

Digging rock from hardscaped beds, I think, is a bit like not writing poetry—like thinking about writing poetry but digging rock from my backyard instead. If you’ve never pulled rock, with your own gloved hands, or a trowel, with a at-headed shovel, on your knees, or squatting, or half bending so your back will hurt by nightfall, never learned how best to corral the rugged little stones so you might scoop them and haul them to a container that will bear them away, turn them into some other fool’s problem, or if you have and your ngers remember like mine remember a day’s work that wore holes into sweet, pink, owered, garden gloves— though when I called it quits after laboring more hours than I labored with my daughter, it seemed I’d hardly cleared any rock at all—you might wonder why, when my shovel came down on a pyramid of knob-sized gray and white and speckled stones near the struggling young juniper and opened a nest of lice-small cream eggs and writhing red and black bodies I checked rst that these were not termites— my mercy limited by my love for the wood and mortar I call home—then replaced the river stones on the teeming anthill and turned to clear rock from some other section of my hardscaped bed.

David Goulson,0,"frame as a contender to explain insect declines. Lister, you may recall, had sampled insects in a rainforest in 1976 and 1977, and returned to the same sites after thirty-four years to repeat the exact same sampling in 2011–13. He found that the insect biomass had declined by 80 per cent for samples collected via sweep nets, and a staggering 98 per cent for insects caught on sticky traps. These forests have not been logged or otherwise directly altered by humans in the last thirty years, and no pesticides have been used on or near them so far as anyone knows (which is also true of the Greenland study sites). Ostensibly the forest remained entirely unchanged, except that almost all the insects had vanished. Unlike in Germany, however, according to a weather station within the forest the climate has changed since the late 1970s, with an increase in the mean maximum daily temperature of 2°C. Lister tentatively concluded that this was the most likely cause of the Puerto Rican declines. As one of the ‘referees’of this paper – meaning I was asked to evaluate the quality of the paper as part of the ‘peer-review’process – I could not think of a better explanation, although I was not wholly convinced. Just because the temperature was the only factor that seemed to have changed does not mean that it must be the cause of insect population collapse. There could, for example, have been a devastating epidemic of some unknown insect disease, contamination of the forests with an unidentified pollutant, or a visit to the forest by an army of insect-eating aliens (OK, I’ll admit this one is not particularly likely). My point is only that there are many other possible explanations. The Lister paper attracted a lot of scrutiny, and it emerged that there was a flaw in the evidence that the temperature had actually changed. The recording equipment had been replaced some time between Lister’s two visits to Puerto Rico, and the hike in temperatures, rather than being a gradual process, seemed to coincide with the switch in equipment. In other words it seems likely that the climate hadn’t actually changed as much as the records showed, but rather that the apparent jump in temperature was at least in part an artefact of the changing methods used to measure it. Some critical reviews were published, suggesting that the paper was fatally flawed, but if we put the climate issue to one side, the core findings of the paper – that there had been a massive decline in insect abundance – remain unchallenged. The explanation, however, is still disputed. For the moment, the future climate of our planet is still in our hands. We have already profoundly altered it, but if we were to act decisively we could prevent it becoming much worse. The dire projections of what the world might look like by the end of the century need not come true. In 2016, 196 governments from around the world made commitments to keep climate change below a maximum of 2°C, and ideally no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in the Paris Agreement. In the years since, not one single major industrial nation has got on track to fulfil those commitments. All the measures put in place so far to tackle climate change, such as the proliferation of green energy sources (wind, solar, wave etc.), the move to more fuel-efficient cars, better insulation of homes and so on have had no measurable effect on carbon dioxide emissions, which continue to rise at an accelerating rate every year.fn3 We have simply been using more energy than ever before, more than wiping out the benefits of these new technologies. You might expect that creating green energy would reduce the need for energy from fossil fuels, but it has not worked out that way so far. Instead, our energy-hungry economy simply sucks up all the energy it can get, and cries out for more. In the meantime, Donald Trump pulled the USA out of the Paris Agreement (although fortunately Joe Biden reversed this on his first day in office). You can see for yourself how countries’efforts to combat climate change compare on the Climate Action Tracker website (https://climateactiontracker.org). Only Morocco and the Gambia are on track to meet their promises in the Paris Agreement, two tiny countries with almost zero emissions to start with. Countries whose efforts are woefully inadequate, and likely to see us heading towards global warming of 4°C or more (catastrophic for all life on Earth), include the USA, Saudi Arabia and Russia. It is perhaps not a coincidence that these three countries happen to be the three biggest oil producers in the world. One might be forgiven for suspecting that their heart is not really in tackling climate change at all. In the case of the USA this was abundantly clear under the Trump administration. Interestingly, Russia has other reasons to ignore the perils of climate change, for many Russian ports currently become unusable during the winter months due to sea ice, but will soon be ice-free for much or all of the year. In addition, vast tracts of northern lands that are currently too cold for crop production will become suitable for growing cereals, so that Russia may be able to step into the gap created when the USA wheat crops start to fail. We should not expect help in tackling climate change from Vladimir Putin any time soon. The fundamental problem with the Paris Agreement is that it has no teeth at all. It relies entirely on countries choosing to cut their own emissions, with no penalty if they fail. It is very easy for a government to make a long-term promise, knowing that different politicians will be in charge by the time any reckoning is due. One only has to look at the 1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, which was signed by almost exactly the same group of 196 governments as signed the Paris Agreement. In the Rio Convention our governments promised to halt the loss of global biodiversity by 2020. In reality, the period 1992 to 2020 has seen the greatest loss of global biodiversity for at least 65 million years. We cannot rely on the empty promises of our governments to save our planet. Vein-cutting Monarchs The monarch butterfly of North America is famed for its beauty and for its extraordinary migration from Canada to overwintering sites in Mexico, but its caterpillars have their own remarkable behaviour. They feed upon the leaves of milkweed, a plant named after the white, sticky sap that flows from damaged leaves, also known as latex. Latex is produced by many plants, and some types are harvested to make into rubber. Naturally, latex has two purposes: it dries and blocks the wound, acting like a scab, and it sticks to and poisons any herbivore attempting to nibble the plant’s leaves. It successfully deters many insects, but a few, including the caterpillars of the monarch butterfly, have worked out how to overcome this defence. The caterpillar simply chews a trench across the base of a leaf, severing the latex-containing vessels and allowing the latex to drain out, so that it can then enjoy consuming the remaining, undefended portion of the leaf. 12 Bauble Earth We have all seen the dramatic satellite images of the Earth at night, its land masses etched with an orange glow from billions of electrical lights, hanging like a Christmas bauble in space. North America, Europe, India, China and Japan in particular are lit up with a festive light. Every city is visible, with the great metropolises gleaming brightest, and most coastlines glimmering with a ribbon of human development. Very few places on land are truly dark, aside from the frozen wastes near the poles, the great deserts, and a few remaining parts of the Amazon and the Congo. It is estimated that the amount of light we are casting at night increases every year by between 2 and 6 per cent. Every day the human population increases by about 225,000: enough for a new city every night, for a new gleaming spot of light visible from space. Most of the nature reserves on which insects were trapped in the German study are reasonably close to urban areas. Even if bright lights are not always directly visible from the reserves, skyglow, as we call the scattered light pollution visible in the atmosphere above cities, can be seen hundreds of kilometres from its source. Some scientists have argued that light pollution may have contributed to the dramatic decline in insects. But is this a plausible explanation? Let’s consider what harm light pollution might do to insects. More than 60 per cent of invertebrates are nocturnal, and most use light from the stars or Moon as a cue for navigation and orientation. Artificial lights attract flying insects such as moths and flies. Clearly disorientated, they bash themselves against the light, becoming burned or damaged, exhausting themselves and making themselves vulnerable to predation. I vividly recall camping out many years ago on a campsite in tropical Australia which had low-level lighting on posts to illuminate the paths to the toilet block. At night, every light had at least one fat cane toad squatting beneath it, hoovering up the near-endless supply of insects that blundered into the lamps. In Spain, similarly, I have seen hungry geckos crowd around lights to help themselves to the dazzled insects. Spiders often spin their webs on and under outdoor lights, the webs sometimes becoming thick with flies and other small insects, while bats may take advantage of the clouds of confused insects to swoop in and snatch prey for themselves. In the absence of cane toads, spiders, bats or geckos, come the morning any surviving insects are often left sitting, dazed, in an exposed position on a lamp post or nearby wall where insectivorous birds find them easy pickings. Any keen moth trappers reading this will know that they need to empty their traps at first light or else wrens and tits will quickly learn to climb into the trap and partake of a sumptuous breakfast, leaving nothing but a pile of wings. Why insects are attracted to lights at night has never been fully explained. Moths, after all, do not naturally try to fly to the Moon. There are competing theories, the most popular and convincing of which is based on the notion that insects navigate using the Moon when migrating. An insect intending to travel a long distance in a straight line might fly at a fixed angle to the Moon, gently adjusting the angle as the night progresses and the moon moves across the night sky by using some sort of internal clock. Bees use the sun in a similar way when navigating to and from patches of flowers. The theory is that nocturnal insects mistake a bright light for the Moon, but because it is close to them rather than thousands of miles away, their angle to the light shifts very rapidly if they fly in a straight line. To compensate, they curve towards the light, flying in a decreasing spiral until they crash into the lamp.fn1 Regardless of the explanation, there is no doubt that our artificial lights lead countless billions of insects to an untimely demise each year. Every light is a population ‘sink’, steadily sucking insects from the landscape night after night. It is also likely that our lights lead to more insidious problems. Some insects may not blunder into lights, for instance, but might nonetheless be disorientated. We know, for example, that dung beetles can detect the hazy line of the Milky Way in the sky, using it to help orientate themselves and maintain a straight path when rolling their balls of dung. We do not yet know what confusion it might cause to the beetles if their route passed near an artificial light. Perhaps more importantly, most insects, including those that are primarily active in the daytime, use light as a critical cue in triggering biological clocks. For example, many organisms use day length for timing their life cycle, so they emerge from hibernation, or lay their eggs, at an appropriate time of year. Some insects time their foraging activity to coincide with, or avoid, the time of the month when the Moon is at its brightest. Mayflies time their emergence as adults to coincide with the full Moon. The timing of these cycles is vital: consider what would happen if a mayfly, which lives for just a few hours or days at best, times its emergence incorrectly. Then it will have no-one to mate with, and will die alone, without fulfilling its reproductive potential. There have been few scientific studies of the effects of light pollution on insect cycles of this sort, but it seems highly plausible that insects living near bright lights might mistake a street lamp for the full moon, or the rising sun, and get their timing disastrously wrong. For a few unusual insects, our lights may pose a particular obstacle when it comes to finding a mate. Fireflies and glow-worms emit light to attract a member of the opposite sex. In the European glow-worm, for example, the female insect (they are beetles, not worms) emits a charming greenish glow from her bottom which males find irresistible. For millions of years their luminous bottoms must have been easily spotted in the dark of the night, but now they have to compete with the far brighter lights of humankind. For a male glow-worm, finding yourself attracted to the bright lights of the city would be a disaster. The risk posed by artificial light is also likely to depend on the type of light being used. Moth collectors have long known that lights emitting lots of ultra-violet are most attractive to moths. In Europe, street lights were until recently mainly high-pressure sodium lamps or mercury vapour lamps that emit a lot of UV. To save energy, many are being replaced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which generally emit a broad spectrum of visible, white light and little UV. That may sound like good news for insects, but there is a lot of variability in the proportions of different wavelengths emitted by LEDs, with the ‘cool white’ types producing lots of short-wavelength, blue light. These types seem to be as, or more, attractive to insects than the old sodium lamps. To complicate matters, different insect groups seem to respond differently too, so that LEDs tend to attract more moths and flies, but fewer beetles, compared to sodium lamps. There is no doubt that our lights are the cause of both death and confusion in the insect world, but are they really having a significant effect at the population level? As is so often the case, we do not know the answer. It is hard to design satisfactory real-world experiments on the large scale that would be needed with flying insects. Ideally one might have multiple replicate patches of lit and unlit habitat, each carefully monitored over time, but these patches of land would have to be a very long way apart for the light not to spill over into the ‘unlit’ patches, and skyglow would be a problem unless the experiment could be conducted in a spectacularly remote place such as the middle of the Congo. It would make a fascinating grant application, but I doubt that anyone is likely to fund it anytime soon. Sticky Cave Glow-Worm In the caves of New Zealand lives an unusual creature known to scientists as Arachnocampa luminosa. It has become quite a tourist attraction, with many thousands of visitors queuing to see the tiny animals, which tend to cling to the cave ceiling, where they glow a gentle bluish-green. In caves where they are abundant they can create the illusion of standing beneath a star-filled sky. The sticky cave glow-worm is not a worm, and neither is it related to the glow-worms found in Europe, or the fireflies of North America and the tropics, both of which are actually beetles. Instead it belongs to a group of flies known as fungus gnats. Unlike most fungus gnats, which live up to their name by eating fungi, the sticky cave glow-worm is predatory. The larvae – which could also be called maggots, since they are the immature stage of flies – start glowing as soon as they hatch from their egg. They spin themselves a silken nest on the cave ceiling, and then dangle dozens of silk threads down, each adorned with sticky droplets which glisten like a string of pearls in the light coming from the larva. The light attracts small flying insects, which become stuck to the droplets. The glow-worm larva pulls in the thread, eating it as it goes, and then consumes the struggling insect while it is still alive. 13 Invasions The modern world has seen many organisms redistributed by man from their natural homes to new parts of the globe – sometimes deliberately, but more often by accident. Brown and black rats spread around the world, for example, stowing away in our boats to reach even the most remote oceanic islands. Historically, many deliberate introductions were carried out, sometimes for no good reason. Starlings were introduced to North America in 1890 by the Englishman Eugene Schieffelin, and are now regarded as major pests (while, sadly, their numbers dwindle in the UK). He also unsuccessfully attempted to introduce bullfinches, skylarks, chaffinches and nightingales, apparently because he was a fan of Shakespeare and all these birds are mentioned somewhere in the bard’s works. This might seem slightly nuts to us now, but introducing non-native species for fun was quite fashionable in the nineteenth century, with ‘acclimatisation societies’in America, Australia and New Zealand actively promoting the practice. While some species were introduced for whimsical reasons, others were brought in so they could be hunted, for food or entertainment. Rabbits were released in Australia, where they multiplied like, erm, rabbits, with disastrous ecological and economic consequences. Foxes were also introduced so that British expats had an excuse for donning a red hunting jacket and galloping about the landscape with a pack of hounds. The foxes thrived despite the hounds, helped by the ready availability of rabbits for supper. Had they stuck to eating rabbits all would be well, but unsurprisingly they quickly developed a taste for the native wildlife, particularly for ground-dwelling marsupials such as the greater bilby (now teetering on the edge of extinction as a result), and the lesser bilby (which went extinct in the 1950s). New Zealand lacked anything worthwhile for colonists to hunt, being free of land-based mammals and the Maori having already eaten all the giant moa by the time Europeans arrived. To compensate, the European settlers introduced no less than seven different deer species: red, sika, fallow, white-tailed, sambar, rusa deer and wapiti, along with chamois from the Alps and Himalayan tahr (large mountain goats). The red deer in particular have multiplied to form large herds that cause considerable environmental damage through overgrazing. In the twentieth century, many deliberate introductions of predatory species were carried out with the aim of controlling pests, although often this too did not work out quite as well as planned. The cane toad is perhaps the most famous example, introduced to Australia from South America in the hope that it would consume the insect pests of cultivated sugar cane. Unfortunately nobody had explained this to the toads, which decided instead to eat their way through the rest of the native insect life of Australia, multiplying prodigiously in the process and hopping all over eastern Australia in a brown tide of warty skin. There are now reckoned to be more than 200 million in the country. The rosy wolfsnail provides a less familiar example. It is a native of southern USA, a fast-moving creature (for a snail) that chases down and consumes other species of slug and snail. It was introduced to Hawaii in the 1950s in an attempt to control giant African land snails, which had themselves been introduced as food for people (oh, what a tangled web we weave). The land snails had got out of hand and were consuming crops, but the rosy wolfsnails did little to control them, instead preferring to climb up trees in search of the more tasty indigenous tree snails. Within a few years no less than eight native snail species had been driven to extinction. Although such deliberate introductions of animals are now illegal in many countries, we continue to move bees around the world, as I discuss in chapter 10. We also seem to turn a blind eye to the trade in exotic plants for gardens, which involves large numbers of plants being moved from one country or continent to another. Garden plants can become major invasive weeds: in the UK, Rhododendron, Japanese knotweed, giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam are all well-known examples. Their movement also risks the accidental transport of plant diseases or insect pests, such as myrtle rust to Australia. This South American fungal disease attacks and often kills gum trees, bottlebrush trees, tea trees and many other native Australian shrubs, and has been rampaging through natural ecosystems since its arrival in Australia in 2010. Similarly, the box tree moth, an inconspicuous and normally harmless insect from Asia, was accidentally introduced to Europe in 2007 and is now devastating both ornamental box hedging and our rare wild box trees. Once pests or diseases escape from their native land they often have far more devastating effects than in the ecosystem in which they evolved, where their hosts have had millennia to adapt, and there is generally no way of getting rid of them. Even without the deliberate transport of animals or plants, the scale of global trade in all sorts of goods means that further accidental introductions of non-native species are inevitable. For example, some invasive species have stowed away in shipping containers. The brown marmorated stink bugfn1 is thought to have arrived in the Americas in a shipment of machinery from Asia in 1998, and within just fifteen years had somehow made its way throughout the USA. This large, shield-shaped, mottled brown insect sucks the sap of many different crops, particularly apples, apricots and cherries, leaving scars and dimples on the fruits that render them unsaleable. A major pest of fruit trees and some vegetable crops, it now causes some $37 million of crop damage a year. The Asian hornets mentioned earlier are thought to have arrived in France in a consignment of pottery from China, and have since spread across a large portion of Western Europe. Lurid and wildly inaccurate tabloid headlines have suggested that this species poses a threat to humans, which is nonsense, but it is a major predator of large insects. Unfortunately for beekeepers the Asian hornet is particularly partial to snacking on honeybees: if they locate a hive, worker hornets visit over and over again, picking off a bee each time and carrying it back to their nest, so that the honeybee colony slowly dwindles in size. Other pests have stowed away in consignments of food, aided by the vast global trade in fresh produce. For example, spotted wing drosophila from Japan were first discovered in California in 2008. These tiny flies, just 3 millimetres long, lay their eggs in slightly under-ripe fruit, so that by the time it is ripe it is full of maggots. The species can race through thirteen generations a year, and so has the potential to multiply prodigiously. It prefers cherries, berries, peaches, grapes and other soft-skinned fruits, and in its first year of arrival in the USA it is estimated to have cost the fruit industry an eye-watering $500 million. I have a friend who lives in Davis, California, who used to pick baskets of delicious cherries from the tree in his garden every year. Since the spotted winged drosophilas arrived, however, he has not had a single edible cherry – every single one now contains a mass of wriggling maggots. You may be wondering what all this has to do with insect declines, since many of these insects are doing rather too well. But of course the changes wrought by invaders can often have major adverse consequences for native wildlife, including insects. Some invaders, such as Asian hornets and cane toads, are predators of insects. Take the mosquito fish from the Americas, for instance, which was introduced all over the world to help control mosquitoes. Mosquito fish consume not just mosquito larvae but also any other aquatic insect life they can find. Rats and other introduced rodents in New Zealand are a major threat to the indigenous giant weta (a huge, slow-moving, flightless cricket that is now near extinction). Harlequin ladybirds from Asia have greatly reduced the abundance of native ladybirds in the UK. Accidentally introduced ant species, such as the fire ant and Argentine ant, can have profound impacts on native insect life, particularly on other ants. For example, the Argentine ant,fn2 which, as you might guess, comes from South America, has invaded southern Europe, USA, Japan, South Africa and Australia, plus many oceanic islands, even including remote places such as Easter Island. It more or less entirely exterminates local ant species as it invades, with knock-on effects on ecosystems such as reduced seed dispersal (some native ants carry seeds about). In southern California, a massive drop in native ant numbers is driving declines in the rare horned lizard, a specialist ant predator that unfortunately doesn’t seem to enjoy eating Argentine ants.fn3 The spread of alien competitors or predators such as Asian hornets has a direct impact on other insect life, while the spread of plant pests can have indirect impacts on the species associated with the plants under attack. Dutch elm disease is a well-known example. Elms were once among the most common and impressive of trees in the UK, north-western Europe and large parts of North America. The English elm grew to about 45 metres tall, and features in iconic paintings of the English landscape such as Constable’s Salisbury Cathedral from the South-West. In 1910 signs of elm ill-health began to emerge in continental Europe, with dead branches appearing in the crown of trees. In 1921 a team of Dutch scientists identified the disease as being caused by a fungus originating from Asia, and it is from this that the rather unhelpful name of the disease was coined. The disease was thought to have probably arrived in Europe in shipments of timber, and is spread from tree to tree by various types of native wood-boring beetle. It jumped from Europe to North America in 1928, once again in a shipment of logs. In Europe, the early outbreaks were mild and rarely caused the death of trees, but in 1967 a more virulent strain arrived from Japan via Canadian logs shipped to the UK for boat building. Within a decade, 25 million trees died in the UK alone. I was born in 1965, and I vividly remember the landscape of my childhood as being full of skeletal, dying and dead trees. English elms do survive as hedgerow suckers, for the disease does not attack small plants, but there are very few mature trees left in the UK. The wholesale loss of major plant species like elms is bound to have had impacts on the associated insect life, for more than a hundred species of insect were associated with elms in the UK. The two best known are the white-letter hairstreak and the large tortoiseshell butterflies, the former now a very scarce species and the latter extinct as a resident breeding species since the 1960s. The plight of insects associated with elms was probably exacerbated by well-intentioned attempts to control the spread of the disease with insecticides aimed at the wood-boring beetles that spread the fungi. In the USA in the 1950s and 1960s DDT and its relative dieldrin were sprayed three times a year onto elms, resulting in the death of large numbers of woodland birds and, although not documented, almost certainly wiping out large numbers of insects. Now the elm story seems to be repeating itself with ash trees. Ash dieback is also a fungal disease from Asia, where it naturally infects but does little harm to native ash species. The fungus wasn’t formally described until 2006, but we think it arrived in Europe in about 1992 when trees with symptoms of dieback were first found in Poland. Even once the disease was well recognised in continental Europe and known to pose a significant threat to ash trees, the UK continued to import ash saplings from Europe until 2012. The first infected trees were recorded that year, close to the sites that had received imported saplings. The government banned further imports and ordered that over 100,000 nursery trees be destroyed, but by that time the fungus was here. Luckily a small proportion of ash trees, perhaps 5 per cent, seem to be resistant to the disease, so although we may lose most of our ash trees we can at least replant with the offspring of resistant ones. Unfortunately they may then be wiped out by yet another Asian plague which seems to be heading our way, courtesy of a tiny but beautiful metallic green beetle called the emerald ash borer, that since 2002 has devastated ash trees across North America, killing tens of millions of trees. In 2013 the beetle was recorded about 250 kilometres west of Moscow, and as it is spreading at a rate of about 40 kilometres a year there seems every chance it will spread across Europe. I have two lovely mature ash trees in my garden in Sussex. Both now have ash dieback, and over the coming years I will have to watch them slowly die. As with the loss of elms, there will undoubtedly be consequences for wildlife. No fewer than 239 invertebrate species and 548",103110
Greta Thunberg,1,"to that challenge. But I want to ask you all the same. I ask you to prove me wrong. For the sake of your children, for the sake of your grandchildren. For the sake of life and this beautiful living planet. I ask you to stand on the right side of history. I ask you to pledge to do everything in your power to push your own business or government in line with a 1.5°C world. Will you pledge to do that? Will you pledge to join me, and the people all around the world, in doing whatever it takes? Our House is On Fire World Economic Forum Davos, 25 January 2019 Our house is on fire. I am here to say, our house is on fire. According to the IPCC, we are less than twelve years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place – including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50 per cent. And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris Agreement work on a global scale. Nor does it include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost. At places like Davos, people like to tell success stories. But their financial success has come with an unthinkable price-tag. And on climate change, we have to acknowledge that we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so. And the media has failed to create broad public awareness. But Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognize the overall failures of our current systems we most probably don’t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases. And either we do that or we don’t. You say that nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent a 1.5°C of warming or we don’t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control – or we don’t. Either we choose to go on as a civilization or we don’t. That is as black or white as it gets. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Now we all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail. That is up to you and me. Some say that we should not engage in activism. Instead we should leave everything to our politicians and just vote for a change instead. But what do we do when there is no political will? What do we do when the politics needed are nowhere in sight? Here in Davos – just like everywhere else – everyone is talking about money. It seems that money and growth are our only main concerns. And since the climate crisis is a crisis that never once has been treated as a crisis, people are simply not aware of the full consequences from our everyday life. People are not aware that there is such a thing as a carbon budget and just how incredibly small that remaining carbon budget is. And that needs to change today. No other current challenge can match the importance of establishing a wide, public awareness and understanding of our rapidly disappearing carbon budget, that should and must become our new global currency and the very heart of our future and present economics. We are now at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilization and the entire biosphere must speak out. In clear language. No matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be. We must change almost everything in our current societies. The bigger your carbon footprint – the bigger your moral duty. The bigger your platform – the bigger your responsibility. Adults keep saying: ‘We owe it to the young people to give them hope.’ But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is. I’m Too Young to Do This Facebook Stockholm, 2 February 2019 Recently I’ve seen many rumours circulating about me and enormous amounts of hate. This is no surprise to me. I know that since most people are not aware of the full meaning of the climate crisis (which is understandable since it has never been treated as a crisis) a school strike for the climate would seem very strange to people in general. So let me make some things clear about my school strike. In May 2018 I was one of the winners in a writing competition about the environment held by Svenska Dagbladet, a Swedish newspaper. I got my article published and some people contacted me, among others was Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland. He had some kind of group with people, especially youth, who wanted to do something about the climate crisis. I had a few phone meetings with other activists. The purpose was to come up with ideas of new projects that would bring attention to the climate crisis. Bo had a few ideas of things we could do. Everything from marches to a loose idea of some kind of school strike (that schoolchildren would do something on the schoolyards or in the classrooms). That idea was inspired by the Parkland students, who had refused to go to school after the school shootings. I liked the idea of a school strike. So I developed that idea and tried to get the other young people to join me, but no one was really interested. They thought that a Swedish version of the Zero Hour march was going to have a bigger impact. So I went on planning the school strike all by myself and after that I didn’t participate in any more meetings. When I told my parents about my plans, they weren’t very fond of it. They did not support the idea of school striking and they said that if I were to do this I would have to do it completely by myself and with no support from them. On the 20th of August I sat down outside the Swedish parliament. I handed out fliers with a long list of facts about the climate crisis and explanations on why I was striking. The first thing I did was to post on Twitter and Instagram what I was doing and it soon went viral. Then journalists and newspapers started to come. A Swedish entrepreneur and businessman active in the climate movement, Ingmar Rentzhog, was among the first to arrive. He spoke with me and took pictures that he posted on Facebook. That was the first time I had ever met or spoken with him. I had not communicated or encountered with him ever before. Many people love to spread rumours saying that I have people ‘behind me’ or that I’m being ‘paid’ or ‘used’ to do what I’m doing. But there is no one ‘behind’ me except for myself. My parents were as far from climate activists as possible before I made them aware of the situation. I am not part of any organization. I sometimes supported and cooperated with several NGOs that work with the climate and environment. But I am absolutely independent and I only represent myself. And I do what I do completely for free, I have not received any money or any promise of future payments in any form at all. And nor has anyone linked to me or my family done so. And of course it will stay this way. I have not met one single climate activist who is fighting for the climate for money. That idea is completely absurd. Furthermore, I only travel with permission from my school, and my parents pay for tickets and accommodation. My family has written a book together about our family and how I and my sister, Beata, have influenced my parents’ way of thinking and seeing the world, especially when it comes to the climate. And about our diagnoses. That book was due to be released in May 2018. But since there was a major disagreement with the book company, we ended up changing to a new publisher, and so the book was released in August the same year instead. Before the book was released my parents made it clear that their possible profits from the book, Scener ur hjärtat, ‘Scenes From the Heart’, will be going to eight different charities working with the environment, children with diagnoses and animal rights. And yes, I write my own speeches. But since I know that what I say is going to reach many, many people, I often ask for input. I also have a few scientists that I frequently ask for help on how to express certain complicated matters. I want everything to be absolutely correct so that I don’t spread incorrect facts, or things that can be misunderstood. Some people mock me for my diagnosis. But Asperger is not a disease, it’s a gift. People also say that since I have Asperger I couldn’t possibly have put myself in this position. But that’s exactly why I did this. Because if I would have been ‘normal’ and social I would have organized myself in an organization, or started an organization by myself. But since I am not that good at socializing I did this instead. I was so frustrated that nothing was being done about the climate crisis, and I felt like I had to do something, anything. And sometimes NOT doing things – like just sitting down outside the parliament – speaks much louder than doing things. Just like a whisper sometimes is louder than shouting. Also there is one complaint that I ‘sound and write like an adult’. And to that I can only say: Don’t you think that a sixteen-year-old can speak for herself? There are some people who say that I oversimplify things. For example when I say that ‘The climate crisis is a black and white issue’, ‘We need to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases’, and ‘I want you to panic.’ But that I only say because it’s true. Yes, the climate crisis is the most complex issue that we have ever faced and it’s going to take everything from our part to ‘stop it’. But the solution is black and white: we need to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. Because either we limit the warming to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels, or we don’t. Either we reach a tipping point where we start a chain reaction with events way beyond human control, or we don’t. Either we go on as a civilization, or we don’t. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. And when I say that I want you to panic, I mean that we need to treat the crisis as a crisis. When your house is on fire you don’t sit down and talk about how nice you can rebuild it once you put out the fire. If your house is on fire you run outside and make sure that everyone is out while you call the fire department. That requires some level of panic. There is one other argument that I can’t do anything about. And that is the fact that I’m ‘just a child and we shouldn’t be listening to children’. But that is easily fixed – just start to listen to the rock-solid science instead. Because if everyone listened to the scientists and the facts that I constantly refer to then no one would have to listen to me or any of the other hundreds of thousands of school-children on strike for the climate across the world. Then we could all go back to school. I am just a messenger, and yet I get all this hate. I am not saying anything new, I am just saying what scientists have repeatedly said for decades. And I agree with you, I’m too young to do this. We children shouldn’t have to do this. But since almost no one is doing anything, and our very future is at risk, we feel like we have to continue. And if you have any other concern or doubt about me, then you can listen to my TED talk, in which I talk about how my interest for the climate and environment began. And thank you everyone for your kind support! It brings me hope. You’re Acting Like Spoiled, Irresponsible Children European Economic and Social Committee ‘Civil Society for rEUnaissance’ Brussels, 21 February 2019 My name is Greta Thunberg, I am a climate activist from Sweden and today in this room there are also – if you can come up – Anuna, Adélaïde, Kyra, Gilles, Dries, Toon and Luisa. Tens of thousands of children or schools are striking for the climate on the streets of Brussels. Hundreds of thousands are doing the same all over the world. We are school-striking because we have done our homework. And some of us are here today. People always tell us that they are so hopeful. They are hopeful that the young people are going to save the world, but we are not. There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge. Because by the year 2020 we need to have bended the emissions curve steep downward. That is next year. We know that most politicians don’t want to talk to us. Good, we don’t want to talk to them either. We want them to talk to the scientists instead. Listen to them, because we are just repeating what they are saying and have been saying for decades. We want you to follow the Paris Agreement and the IPCC reports. We don’t have any other manifestos or demands – you unite behind the science, that is our demand. When many politicians talk about the school strike for the climate, they talk about almost anything except for the climate crisis. Many people are trying to make the school strikes a question of whether we are promoting truancy or whether we should go back to school or not. They make up all sorts of conspiracies and call us puppets who cannot think for ourselves. They are desperately trying to remove the focus from the climate crisis and change the subject. They don’t want to talk about it because they know they cannot win this fight. Because they know they haven’t done their homework, but we have. Once you have done your homework you realize that we need new politics, we need new economics where everything is based on a rapidly declining and extremely limited remaining carbon budget. But that is not enough. We need a whole new way of thinking. The political system that you have created is all about competition. You cheat when you can, because all that matters is to win, to get power. That must come to an end, we must stop competing with each other, we need to cooperate and work together and to share the resources of the planet in a fair way. We need to start living within the planetary boundaries, focus on equity and take a few steps back for the sake of all living species. We need to protect the biosphere, the air, the oceans, the soil, the forests. This may sound very naive, but if you have done your homework then you know that we don’t have any other choice. We need to focus every inch of our being on climate change, because if we fail to do so then all our achievements and progress have been for nothing and all that will remain of our political leaders’ legacy will be the greatest failure of human history. And they will be remembered as the greatest villains of all time, because they have chosen not to listen and not to act. But this does not have to be. There is still time. According to the IPCC report we are about eleven years away from being in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control. To avoid that unprecedented change in all aspects of society, [actions] need to have taken place within this coming decade, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50 per cent by the year 2030. And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris Agreement work on a global scale, nor do they include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost. They do, however, include negative emission techniques on a huge planetary scale that is yet to be invented, and that many scientists fear will never be ready in time and will anyway be impossible to deliver at the scale assumed. We have been told that the EU intends to improve its emission reduction targets. In the new target, the EU is proposing to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions to 45 per cent below 1990’s level by 2030. Some people say that is good or that is ambitious. But this new target is still not enough to keep global warming below 1.5°C. This target is not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today. If the EU is to make its fair contribution to staying within the carbon budget for the 2°C limit, then it means a minimum of 80 per cent reduction by 2030 and that includes aviation and shipping. So, it is around twice as ambitious as the current proposal. The actions required are beyond manifestos or any party politics. Once again, they sweep their mess under the carpet for our generation to clean up and solve. Some people say that we are fighting for our future, but that is not true. We are not fighting for our future, we are fighting for everyone’s future. And if you think that we should be in school instead, then we suggest that you take our place in the streets striking from your work. Or better yet, join us so it can speed up the process. And I am sorry, but saying everything will be all right while continuing doing nothing at all is just not hopeful to us. In fact, it’s the opposite of hope. And yet this is exactly what you keep doing. You can’t just sit around waiting for hope to come – you’re acting like spoiled, irresponsible children. You don’t seem to understand that hope is something you have to earn. And if you still say that we are wasting valuable lesson time, then let me remind you that our political leaders have wasted decades through denial and inaction. And since our time is running out we have decided to take action. We have started to clean up your mess and we will not stop until we are done. A Strange World Goldene Kamera Film and TV Awards Berlin, 30 March 2019 I dedicate this award to the people fighting to protect the Hambach Forest. And to activists everywhere who are fighting to keep the fossil fuels in the ground. We live in a strange world, where all the united science tells us that we are about eleven years away from setting off an irreversible chain reaction, way beyond human control, that will probably be the end of our civilization as we know it. We live in a strange world, where children must sacrifice their own education in order to protest against the destruction of their future. Where the people who have contributed the least to this crisis are the ones who are going to be affected the most. Where politicians say it’s too expensive to save the world, while spending trillions of euros subsidizing fossil fuels. We live in a strange world, where no one dares to look beyond our current political systems even though it’s clear that the answers we seek will not be found within the politics of today. Where some people seem to be more concerned about the presence in school of some children than the future of humankind. Where everyone can choose their own reality and buy their own truth. Where our survival is depending on a small, rapidly disappearing carbon budget. And hardly anyone even knows it exists. We live in a strange world, where we think we can buy or build our way out of a crisis that has been created by buying and building things. Where a football game or a film gala gets more media attention than the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. Where celebrities, film and pop stars who have stood up against all injustices will not stand up for our environment and for climate justice because that would inflict on their right to fly around the world visiting their favourite restaurants, beaches and yoga retreats. Avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown is to do the seemingly impossible. And that is what we have to do. But here is the truth: we can’t do it without you in the audience here tonight. People see you celebrities as gods. You influence billions of people. We need you. You can use your voice to raise awareness about this global crisis. You can help turn individuals into movements. You can help us wake up our leaders – and let them know that our house is on fire. We live in a strange world. But it’s the world that my generation has been handed. It’s the only world we’ve got. We are now standing at a crossroads in history. We are failing but we have not yet failed. We can still fix this. It’s up to us. Cathedral Thinking European Parliament Strasbourg, 16 April 2019 My name is Greta Thunberg. I am sixteen years old. I come from Sweden. And I want you to panic. I want you to act as if your house was on fire. I have said those words before. A lot of people have explained why that is a bad idea. A great number of politicians have told me that panic never leads to anything good. And I agree. To panic unless you have to is a terrible idea. But when your house is on fire and you want to keep your house from burning to the ground then that does require some level of panic. Our civilization is so fragile it is almost like a castle built in the sand. The façade is so beautiful but the foundations are far from solid. We have been cutting so many corners. Yesterday the world watched with despair and enormous sorrow how Notre-Dame burned in Paris. Some buildings are more than just buildings. But Notre-Dame will be rebuilt. I hope that its foundations are strong. I hope that our foundations are even stronger. But I fear they are not. Around the year 2030, 10 years, 259 days and 10 hours away from now, we will be in a position where we will set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control that will most likely lead to the end of our civilization as we know it. That is, unless in that time permanent and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society have taken place, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50 per cent. And please note that these calculations are depending on inventions that have not yet been invented at scale. Inventions that are supposed to clear our atmosphere of astronomical amounts of carbon dioxide. Furthermore these calculations do not include unforeseen tipping points and feedback loops, like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing Arctic permafrosts. Nor do they include already locked-in warming, hidden by air pollution, nor the aspect of equity, nor climate justice, clearly stated throughout the Paris Agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale. We must also bear in mind that these are just calculations, estimations, meaning that the point of no return may occur a bit sooner or later than that. No one can know for sure. We can however be certain that they will occur approximately in these time-frames. Because these calculations are not opinions or wild guesses. These predictions are backed up by scientific facts, concluded by all nations through the IPCC. Nearly every major scientific body around the world unreservedly supports the work and findings of the IPCC. We are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction and the extinction rate is up to 10,000 times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day. Erosion of fertile top soil. Deforestation of our great forests. Toxic air pollution. Loss of insects and wildlife. The acidification of our oceans. These are all disastrous trends being accelerated by a way of life that we, here in our financially fortunate part of the world, see as our right to simply carry on. But hardly anyone knows about these catastrophes or understands that they are just the first few symptoms of climate ecological breakdown. Because how could they? They have not been told. Or more importantly, they have not been told by the right people, and in the right way. Our house is falling apart. Our leaders need to start acting accordingly. Because at the moment they are not. If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like you do today. You would change almost every part of your behaviour as you do in an emergency. If our house was falling apart, you wouldn’t fly around the world in business class, chatting about how the market will solve everything with clever, small solutions to specific, isolated problems. You wouldn’t talk about buying and building your way out of a crisis that has been created by buying and building things. If our house was falling apart, you wouldn’t hold three emergency Brexit summits, and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and ecosystems. You wouldn’t be arguing about phasing out coal in fifteen or eleven years. If our house was falling apart, you wouldn’t be celebrating that one single nation, like Ireland, may soon divest from fossil fuels. You wouldn’t celebrate that Norway has decided to stop drilling for oil outside the scenic resort of the Lofoten Islands, but will continue to drill for oil everywhere else, for decades. It’s thirty years too late for that kind of celebration. If our house was falling apart the media wouldn’t be writing about anything else. The ongoing climate and ecological crisis would make up all the headlines. If our house was falling apart, you wouldn’t say that you have the situation under control, and place the future living conditions of all species in the hands of inventions that are yet to be invented. And you would not spend all your time, as politicians, arguing about taxes or Brexit. If the walls of our house truly came tumbling town, surely you would set your differences aside and start cooperating. Well, our house is falling apart. And we are rapidly running out of time. And yet basically nothing is happening. Everyone and everything needs to change. So why waste precious time arguing about what and who needs to change first? Everyone and everything has to change. But the bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. When I tell politicians to act now, the most common answer is that they can’t do anything drastic because it would be too unpopular among the voters. And they are right, of course, since most people are not even aware of why those changes are required. That is why I keep telling you to unite behind the science. Make the best available science the heart of politics and democracy. The EU elections are coming up soon and many of us who will be affected the most by this crisis, people like me, are not allowed to vote. Nor are we in a position to shape the decisions of business, politics, engineering, media, education or science. Because the time it takes for us to educate ourselves to do that simply does no longer exist. And that is why millions of children are taking to the streets, school-striking for the climate to create attention for the climate crisis. You need to listen to us, we who cannot vote. You need to vote for us, for your children and grandchildren. What we are doing now can soon no longer be undone. In this election, you vote for the future living conditions of humankind. And though the politics needed do not exist today, some alternatives are certainly less worse than others. And I have read in the newspapers that some parties do not even want me standing here today because they so desperately do not want to talk about climate breakdown. Our house is falling apart. The future as well",9794
Jane Goodall,1,"moon. If I heard the coughing grunt of a leopard, I just prayed and pulled the blanket over my head! Chimps sleep all night, just as we do. From the Peak I often watched how they made their nests, or beds. First the chimp bent a branch down over some solid foundation, such as a fork or two parallel branches. Holding it in place with his feet, he then bent another over it. Then he folded the end of the first branch back over the second. And so on. He often ended up by picking lots of small, soft, leafy twigs to make a pillow. Chimps like their comfort! I’ve learned over the years that infants sleep in their nest with their mothers until they are about five years old or until the next baby is born and the older child has to make its own bed. I never returned to camp before sunset. But even when I slept on the Peak, I first went down to have supper with Mum and tell her what I had seen that day. And she would tell me what she had been doing. Mum set up a clinic. She handed out medicine to any of the local Africans, mostly fishermen, who were sick. Once she cured an old man who was very ill indeed. Word about this cure spread far and wide, and sometimes patients would walk for miles to get treatment from the wonderful white woman-doctor. Her clinic was very good for me. It meant that the local people realized we wanted to help. When Mum had to go back to England after four months to manage things at home, the Africans wanted, in turn, to help me. Of course, Mum worried about leaving me on my own. Dominic was a wonderful cook and great company, but he did sometimes get very drunk. He was not really reliable. So Louis Leakey asked Hassan to come all the way from Lake Victoria to help with the boat and engine. It was lovely to see his handsome, smiling face again, and his arrival relieved Mum’s mind no end. Of course, I missed her after she’d gone, but I didn’t have time to be lonely. There was so much to do. Soon after she’d left, I got back one evening and was greeted by an excited Dominic. He told me that a big male chimp had spent an hour feeding on the fruit of one of the oil-nut palms growing in the camp clearing. Afterward he had climbed down, gone over to my tent, and taken the bananas that had just been put there for my supper. This was fantastic news. For months the chimps had been running off when they saw me—now one had actually visited my camp! Perhaps he would come again. The next day I waited, in case he did. What a luxury to lie in until 7:00 A.M. As the hours went by I began to fear that the chimp wouldn’t come. But finally, at about four in the afternoon, I heard a rustling in the undergrowth opposite my tent, and a black shape appeared on the other side of the clearing. I recognized him at once. It was the handsome male with the dense white beard. I had already named him David Greybeard. Quite calmly he climbed into the palm and feasted on its nuts. And then he helped himself to the bananas I had set out for him. David Greybeard. Photograph by Hugo van Lawick, © National Geographic Society. There were ripe palm nuts on that tree for another five days, and David Greybeard visited three more times and got lots of bananas. A month later, when another palm tree in camp bore ripe fruit, David again visited us. And on one of those occasions he actually took a banana from my hand. I could hardly believe it. From that time on things got easier for me. Sometimes when I met David Greybeard out in the forest, he would come up to see if I had a banana hidden in my pocket. The other chimps stared with amazement. Obviously I wasn’t as dangerous as they had thought. Gradually they allowed me closer and closer. It was David Greybeard who provided me with my most exciting observation. One morning, near the Peak, I came upon him squatting on a termite mound. As I watched, he picked a blade of grass, poked it into a tunnel in the mound, and then withdrew it. The grass was covered with termites all clinging on with their jaws. He picked them off with his lips and scrunched them up. Then he fished for more. When his piece of grass got bent, he dropped it, picked up a little twig, stripped the leaves off it, and used that. I was really thrilled. David had used objects as tools! He had also changed a twig into something more suitable for fishing termites. He had actually made a tool. Before this observation, scientists had thought that only humans could make tools. Later I would learn that chimpanzees use more objects as tools than any creature except for us. This finding excited Louis Leakey more than any other. In October the dry season ended and it began to rain. Soon the golden mountain slopes were covered with lush green grass. Flowers appeared, and the air smelled lovely. Most days it rained just a little. Sometimes there was a downpour. I loved being out in the forest in the rain. And I loved the cool evenings when I could lace the tent shut and make it cozy inside with a storm lantern. The only trouble was that everything got damp and grew mold. Scorpions and giant poisonous centipedes sometimes appeared in the tent—even, a few times, a snake. But I was lucky—I never got stung or bitten. The chimpanzees often seemed miserable in the rain. They looked cold, and they shivered. Since they were clever enough to use tools, I was surprised that they had not learned to make shelters. Many of them got coughs and colds. Often, during heavy rain, they seemed irritable and bad tempered. Once, as I walked through thick forest in a downpour, I suddenly saw a chimp hunched in front of me. Quickly I stopped. Then I heard a sound from above. I looked up and there was a big chimp there, too. When he saw me he gave a loud, clear wailing wraaaah—a spine-chilling call that is used to threaten a dangerous animal. To my right I saw a large black hand shaking a branch and bright eyes glaring threateningly through the foliage. Then came another savage wraaaah from behind. Up above, the big male began to sway the vegetation. I was surrounded. I crouched down, trying to appear as nonthreatening as possible. Suddenly a chimp charged straight toward me. His hair bristled with rage. At the last minute he swerved and ran off. I stayed still. Two more chimps charged nearby. Then, suddenly, I realized I was alone again. All the chimps had gone. Only then did I realize how frightened I had been. When I stood up my legs were trembling! Male chimps, although they are only four feet tall when upright, are at least three times stronger than a grown man. And I weighed only about ninety pounds. I had become very thin with so much climbing in the mountains and only one meal a day. That incident took place soon after the chimps had lost their initial terror of me but before they had learned to accept me calmly as part of their forest world. If David Greybeard had been among them, they probably would not have behaved like that, I thought. After my long days in the forests I looked forward to supper. Dominic always had it ready for me when I got back in the evenings. Once a month he went into Kigoma with Hassan. They came back with new supplies, including fresh vegetables and fruit and eggs. And they brought my mail— that was something I really looked forward to. After supper I would get out the little notebook in which I had scribbled everything I had seen while watching the chimps during the day. I would settle down to write it all legibly into my journal. It was very important to do that every evening, while it was all fresh in my mind. Even on days when I climbed back to sleep near the chimps, I always wrote up my journal first. Gradually, as the weeks went by, I began to recognize more and more chimpanzees as individuals. Some, like Goliath, William, and old Flo, I got to know well, because David Greybeard sometimes brought them with him when he visited camp. I always had a supply of bananas ready in case the chimps arrived. Once you have been close to chimps for a while they are as easy to tell apart as your classmates. Their faces look different, and they have different characters. David Greybeard, for example, was a calm chimp who liked to keep out of trouble. But he was also very determined to get his own way. If he arrived in camp and couldn’t find any bananas, he would walk into my tent and search. Afterward, all was chaos. It looked as though some burglar had raided the place! Goliath had a much more excitable, impetuous temperament. William, with his long-shaped face, was shy and timid. Old Flo was easy to identify. She had a bulbous nose and ragged ears. She came to camp with her infant daughter, whom I named Fifi, and her juvenile son, Figan. Sometimes adolescent Faben came, too. It was from Flo that I first learned that in the wild, female chimps have only one baby every five or six years. The older offspring, even after they have become independent, still spend a lot of time with their mothers, and all the different family members help one another. The author and David Greybeard.

This was a sign that she was ready for mating. She was followed by a long line of suitors. Many of them had never visited my camp before, and they were scared. But they were so attracted to Flo that they overcame their fear in order to keep close to her. She allowed them all to mate with her at different times. Soon after the chimps had begun to visit my camp, the National Geographic Society, which was giving Louis money for my research, sent a photographer to Gombe to make a film. Hugo van Lawick was a Dutch baron. He loved and respected animals just as I did, and he made a wonderful movie. One year later, in England, we got married. By then I had left Gombe for a while, to start my own studies at Cambridge University. I hated to leave, but I knew I would soon be back. I had promised Louis that I would work hard and get my Ph.D. degree. After I got the degree, Hugo and I went back to Gombe together. It was a very exciting time, as Flo has just had a baby, little Flint. That was the first wild chimpanzee infant that I ever saw close up, nearly four years after I had begun my research. Flo came very often to camp looking for bananas. Fifi, now six years old, and Figan, five years older, were still always with her. Fifi loved her new baby brother. When he was four months old she was allowed to play with and groom him. Sometimes Flo let her carry him when they moved through the forest. During that time, Fifi learned a lot about how to be a good mother. Fifi looking for the bananas we sometimes hid under our shirts. Photograph by Hugo van Lawick, © National Geographic Society. Flint learned to walk and climb when he was six months old. And he learned to ride on his mother’s back during travel, instead of always clinging on underneath. He gradually spent more time playing with his two older brothers. They were always very gentle with him. So were other youngsters of the community. They had to be, for if Flo thought any other chimps were too rough, she would charge over and threaten or even attack them. I watched how Flint gradually learned to use more and more of the different calls and gestures that chimpanzees use to communicate with each other. Some of these gestures are just like ours—holding hands, embracing, kissing, patting one another on the back. They mean about the same, too. And although they do not make up a language the way human words do, all the different calls do help the chimpanzees know what is happening, even if they are far away when they hear the sounds. Each call (there are at least thirty, perhaps more), means something different. Flo was the top-ranked female of her community and could dominate all the others. But she could not boss any of the males. In chimpanzee society, males are the dominant sex. Among the males themselves, there is a social order, and one male at the top is the boss. The first top-ranking male I knew was Goliath. Then, in 1964, Mike took over. He did this by using his brain. He would gather up one or two empty kerosene cans from my camp and hit and kick them ahead of him as he charged toward a group of adult males. It was a spectacular performance and made a lot of noise. The other chimps fled. So Mike didn’t need to fight to get to the top—which was just as well, as he was a very small chimp. He was top male for six years. The adult males spend a lot of time in each other’s company. They often patrol the boundaries of their territory and may attack chimpanzees of different communities if they meet. These conflicts are very brutal, and the victim may die. Only young females can move from one community to another without being hurt. In fact, the big males sometimes go out looking for such females and try to take them back into their own territory. As the months went by, I learned more and more. I recorded more and more details when I watched the chimpanzees. Instead of writing the information in notebooks, I started to use a little tape recorder. Then I could keep my eyes on the chimps all the time. By the end of each day there was so much typing to be done that I found I couldn’t do it all myself. I needed an assistant to help. Soon, with even more chimps coming to camp, I needed other people to help with the observations. There were always more fascinating things to watch and record, more people to help write everything down. What had started as a little camp for Mum and me ended up, six years later, as a research center, where students could come and collect information for their degrees. I was the director. In 1967, something special happened. For me it was the most important event of my life. I had a baby of my own. CHAPTER 7 The Africans said my son should have been called Simba, Swahili for lion. This is why. Just before he was born, I was camping with Hugo in Ngorongoro Crater. The crater is the inside of a giant volcano that blew its top off millions of years ago. Now it is one hundred square miles of grassland and trees, a lake, and some little rivers. It is one of the most beautiful places in the world. And it is famous for its wildlife, especially its beautiful black-maned lions. One evening, Hugo and I were waiting for our cook, Anyango, to walk over with supper. Suddenly the quiet African night was filled with shouting, then with banging and clattering sounds as though someone was throwing pots and pans. After a few moments of silence we heard the sound of ripping canvas, more shouting, and more banging. Hugo put his head out to see what on earth was going on. But he quickly ducked back inside and zipped up the front of the tent. He looked a bit pale. “There’s a lion out there,” he said. “It’s between us and the Land Rover.” In the bush you always park your car close to your tent so that you can leap into it if there is an emergency. If the lion was between the tent and the car, we knew it was very close indeed. “It must have ripped open the kitchen tent,” said Hugo. “Or Anyango’s, or Thomas’,” I said. Thomas, who helped with odd jobs around the camp, had a little tent next to Anyango’s. Both were near the kitchen tent. Suppose the lion ripped open our tent. We decided to light the small gas stove. If a lion tried to enter we would light newspapers and wave them in its face. A few moments later we heard racing footsteps. The car door opened and slammed shut. Almost at once there were more running footsteps and again the car door opened and slammed shut. Obviously Anyango and Thomas had reached safety. Hugo cautiously zipped open the tent. There was no sign of a lion. Hugo scrambled into the car. He inched it forward, and I got in, too. Anyango and Thomas told us there were three lions. We switched on the headlights and looked for them. Soon we saw them—young males with their manes just beginning to sprout. We began to try herding them away from our camp. At first they didn’t want to go. They were curious and a bit playful. But eventually they wandered off into the night. We drove back and—oh, dear! —the first thing we saw was the flickering of flames. We had left the front flap of our tent loose, and the wind had blown it against the stove. Luckily we had a fire extinguisher in the car and soon put the fire out. Then we heard the story from Anyango and Thomas. Anyango was just going to serve our supper. Suddenly he looked up and saw a lion’s head framed in the entrance of the tent. Yelling loudly, he hurled saucepans and frying pans at it. The head vanished. Anyango called a warning to Thomas, who was resting in his little tent. Quickly Thomas closed the flap. But to his horror, a moment later the whole tent shook, and a great gash appeared in the side of it. A lion’s head peered in through the opening. Thomas, like Anyango, pelted the intruder with everything he could see. Fortunately, instead of getting angry, the lions wandered away. Peering cautiously into the night, Anyango, with his sharp African eyes, saw the third lion—the one who had visited Hugo and me—following his two companions behind the tents. That was when he and Thomas decided to run for safety. It was silly of them, because lions, like cats, love to chase running, fast-moving things. But they were lucky. They made it. Obviously we could not sleep in our torn and burned tents that night. We ate our supper—which was still hot. Then we packed up a few essentials and drove to a little log cabin nearby. We had stayed there before. The young couple who had been living in it had just left, so we knew it was empty. Imagine how we felt when, as we drove toward it, we saw a very large black-maned lion on the veranda! And behind the cabin was his lioness, feasting on a freshly caught antelope! Eventually the male left. We managed to get into the cabin without disturbing the lioness, and Anyango and Thomas bolted themselves into the little wooden kitchen hut for the night. No wonder they thought that my son, born so soon afterward, should have been called Simba! As it was, he became known as Grub to his family and closest friends. There was no very good reason for this. His real name is Hugo Eric Louis. When Grub was a tiny baby, Hugo and I were studying hyenas in Ngorongoro Crater. You probably think of hyenas as skulking, cowardly scavengers, waiting for scraps left by the lions. Don’t believe it! They are great hunters, going after wildebeestes and zebras, as well as smaller creatures. Quite often, especially in the crater, they actually lose their kills to scavenging lions. They try to defend their prey fiercely at such times. They do also feed on the remains of lions’ kills, but they do not always wait patiently until the lion has finished. If there are enough of them, they try to drive the lions away. Grub taking a bath in the forest. Photograph © Hugo van Lawick. Hyenas are actually very interesting creatures. Like chimps, they wander around in little groups of friendly individuals. Like chimps, they have very distinct personalities and fascinating behavior. Like chimps, they are territorial and may kill hyenas from neighboring clans. The biggest difference in their social behavior is that females are dominant in hyena society, whereas males are dominant in the world of the chimp. I loved studying those Ngorongoro hyenas. At night, when there was a moon, I would drive our VW camper to a hyena den where there were one or two tiny black cubs. Grub was usually asleep in the back of the car. As dusk settled, other, older cubs would begin to appear. They were coming to play with the little ones, the ones who were not old enough to go visiting. What wonderful games went on around those dens in the moonlight! Sometimes the cubs played tag with an ostrich feather or an old bone. They had mock battles and tumbled over and over, wrestling and biting. After hunting, late at night, the hyena mothers would visit the dens. They would suckle their cubs and sometimes bring back a large bone or a whole head from a kill. And there were times when even the biggest and fattest of the mothers, Mrs. Stink and Baggage, for example, would start to play, chasing each other and the cubs around in circles, their fat bellies almost touching the ground. During the months I spent in the crater and afterward, on the Serengeti when Hugo was filming the wild dogs, there were other people at Gombe watching the chimpanzees. I used to talk to them on a two-way radio almost every day. And quite often, we went to Gombe to spend some time there ourselves. Grub in Ngorongoro Crater. Photograph © Hugo van Lawick. But when Grub was small, we had to be very careful. Chimpanzees, as I have said, are hunters. I knew that many years before I had arrived at Gombe, chimpanzees had taken two African babies for food. Of course, that seems shocking to us. But from the chimps’ point of view it is no different to take a human baby than a baboon baby. Some African tribes in West and Central Africa love to eat chimpanzees. Anyway, I took good care to always guard my baby very safely when he came to Gombe. Before he could walk, we built a “cage” for him. It was a safe place for his cot, inside the little one-roomed house where Hugo and I lived. Then Grub began to walk. We could no longer keep him in his safe cage. So we built another house, down on the beach where the chimpanzees only sometimes roamed. We constructed a big, caged-in veranda where Grub could play safely. Grub helping to put up the tent in Ngorongoro Crater. Photograph © Hugo van Lawick. When Grub was outside, he was always with someone—often with me. When he was small, I more or less stopped working with the chimps. I went up to the chimp camp most days, but just to talk to the students, and to see the chimps—Flo and her family and all my other friends. Then I went down to my office in the house on the beach and got on with all the work of running a research center: writing reports, writing articles for scientific books, requesting money so that the work could go on. I had about twelve students and assistants then. It was a lot of work. Then, after lunch, I spent the rest of the day with Grub. We went for walks and looked at books and talked about things. Because Hugo and I didn’t want to send him away to school, we found a tutor for him when he was older. He had regular lessons every morning. When Grub was seven years old, Hugo and I separated and divorced. Hugo’s work, photographing and filming, took him all over the place. And I felt that it was important for me to spend most of my time at Gombe. We stayed good friends, but it was sad, especially for Grub. If I could live that pary of my life over again, I would try very hard to work things out differently. Hugo and I both married again. I married an Englishman, Derek Bryceson. He was the director of Tanzania National Park. Derek had been a fighter pilot in World War II, where he flew Hurricanes. He was shot down in the Middle East when he was just nineteen. After that he was almost completely paralyzed from the waist down. He got about, but with great difficulty, by using a stick—and willpower. Grub and the author at Olduvai Gorge. Photograph © Hugo van Lawick. To visit Gombe, Derek used to fly from his home in Dar es Salaam in a little single-engine four-seater Cessna plane called Mike Whisky. He sometimes flew her himself, but only when she was airborne. He couldn’t land or take off, because you have to use your legs and feet to keep the plane straight and to brake. Sometimes Grub and I flew with him to visit one of Tanzania’s other national parks. One day we flew from Dar es Salaam to a lovely wild park called Ruaha. Derek and the pilot were sitting together in the front. Suddenly they noticed something scary. A little plume of smoke was creeping out from the instrument panel! We were flying over rugged country, and there was nowhere to land until we got to the bush airstrip at Ruaha. That was forty-five minutes away. Derek told us we should try not to worry. We talked of other things. The little wisp of smoke didn’t go away. But it didn’t get any worse, either. At last we got to Ruaha. The pilot came down to land, but there was a herd of zebras on the strip. So he pulled up and circled around. To this day I can’t imagine why, after all that time, the pilot suddenly lost his nerve. Instead of circling right around and coming down on the airstrip, he tried to land among the trees on the far side of the Ruaha River. Wham! We hit the ground. One wing smashed into a tree. We slewed around. The plane crashed on through the bushes and banged into another tree. Finally we came to a stop. The pilot opened his door, yelled, “Get out quickly— she’s going up in flames,” and was gone! I told Grub to follow him. But the door on Derek’s side would open only about two inches. Then it hit the ground. The wheel on that side had buckled, so the plane sat at a crazy angle, the opposite wing high in the air. For a few moments I panicked. How on earth could Derek, with his almost paralyzed legs, get out of the plane before it caught fire? Then he told me to relax, that there would be no fire. And slowly he managed to pull himself up and out through the other door. After getting out of the plane, we had to cross the Ruaha River to get to park headquarters on the other side. We could have waited for a car to come around via the hand-operated ferry, but that was some way upriver and would have taken about thirty minutes. So we decided that despite the big crocodiles in the river, we would risk it and wade across. After all, if God had allowed us to survive the crash, surely He would not allow crocodiles to eat us! And He didn’t! We arrived at the rest house tired and wet, but thankful to be alive and unharmed. By then my legs had begun to shake from delayed shock! We were all glad to sit down and have a nice hot, strong cup of tea. Those trips to Tanzania’s beautiful parks were wonderful, and I learned more and more about many different animals. But I still spent almost all my time at Gombe with the chimps and with the students who came from the United States and Europe to help with the observations or to collect information for their masters or doctoral degrees. In the middle of one night in 1975, some African rebels from Zaire crossed the lake in a motorboat and captured four of the students who were working at Gombe. They tied them up and took them back over the lake. It was very frightening. We didn’t know where they had gone for quite a long time. We didn’t even know if they were alive. All the rest of us had to leave Gombe and go to Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania. Grub and I joined Derek in his house on the shore of the Indian Ocean, and many of the students squeezed into our little",32476
Rachel Carson,1,"almost nonexistent, until such time as careful management, by artificial propagation or other means, has been able to rebuild this commercially important run. There are ways to solve this problem—to preserve the forests and to save the fishes, too. To assume that we must resign ourselves to turning our waterways into rivers of death is to follow the counsel of despair and defeatism. We must make wider use of alternative methods that are now known, and we must devote our ingenuity and resources to developing others. There are cases on record where natural parasitism has kept the budworm under control more effectively than spraying. Such natural control needs to be utilized to the fullest extent. There are possibilities of using less toxic sprays or, better still, of introducing microorganisms that will cause disease among the budworms without affecting the whole web of forest life. We shall see later what some of these alternative methods are and what they promise. Meanwhile, it is important to realize that chemical spraying of forest insects is neither the only way nor the best way. The pesticide threat to fishes may be divided into three parts. One, as we have seen, relates to the fishes of running streams in northern forests and to the single problem of forest spraying. It is confined almost entirely to the effects of DDT. Another is vast, sprawling, and diffuse, for it concerns the many different kinds of fishes—bass, sunfish, trappies, suckers, and others that inhabit many kinds of waters, still or flowing, in many parts of the country. It also concerns almost the whole gamut of insecticides now in agricultural use, although a few principal offenders like endrin, toxaphene, dieldrin, and heptachlor can easily be picked out. Still another problem must now be considered largely in terms of what we may logically suppose will happen in the future, because the studies that will disclose the facts are only beginning to be made. This has to do with the fishes of salt marshes, bays, and estuaries. It was inevitable that serious destruction of fishes would follow the widespread use of the new organic pesticides. Fishes are almost fantastically sensitive to the chlorinated hydrocarbons that make up the bulk of modern insecticides. And when millions of tons of poisonous chemicals are applied to the surface of the land, it is inevitable that some of them will find their way into the ceaseless cycle of waters moving between land and sea. Reports of fish kills, some of disastrous proportions, have now become so common that the United States Public Health Service has set up an office to collect such reports from the states as an index of water pollution. This is a problem that concerns a great many people. Some 25 million Americans look to fishing as a major source of recreation and another 15 million are at least casual anglers. These people spend three billion dollars annually for licenses, tackle, boats, camping equipment, gasoline, and lodgings. Anything that deprives them of their sport will also reach out and affect a large number of economic interests. The commercial fisheries represent such an interest, and even more importantly, an essential source of food. Inland and coastal fisheries (excluding the offshore catch) yield an estimated three billion pounds a year. Yet, as we shall see, the invasion of streams, ponds, rivers, and bays by pesticides is now a threat to both recreational and commercial fishing. Examples of the destruction of fish by agricultural crop sprayings and dustings are everywhere to be found. In California, for example, the loss of some 60,000 game fish, mostly bluegill and other sunfish, followed an attempt to control the riceleaf miner with dieldrin. In Louisiana 30 or more instances of heavy fish mortality occurred in one year alone (1960) because of the use of endrin in the sugarcane fields. In Pennsylvania fish have been killed in numbers by endrin, used in orchards to combat mice. The use of chlordane for grasshopper control on the high western plains has been followed by the death of many stream fish. Probably no other agricultural program has been carried out on so large a scale as the dusting nd spraying of millions of acres of land in southern United States to control the fire ant. Heptachlor, the chemical chiefly used, is only slightly less toxic to fish than DDT. Dieldrin, another fire ant poison, has a well-documented history of extreme hazard to all aquatic life. Only endrin and toxaphene represent a greater danger to fish. All areas within the fire ant control area, whether treated with heptachlor or dieldrin, reported disastrous effects on aquatic life. A few excerpts will give the flavor of the reports from biologists who studied the damage: From Texas, ‘Heavy loss of aquatic life despite efforts to protect canals’, ‘Dead fish...were present in all treated water’, ‘Fish kill was heavyand continued for over 3 weeks’. From Alabama, ‘Most adult fish were killed [in Wilcox County] within a few days after treatment,’ ‘The fish in temporary waters and small tributary streams appeared to have been completely eradicated.’ In Louisiana, farmers complained of loss in farm ponds. Along one canal more than 500 dead fish were seen floating or lying on the bank on a stretch of less than a quarter of a mile. In another parish 150 dead sunfish could be found for every 4 that remained alive. Five other species appeared to have been wiped out completely. In Florida, fish from ponds in a treated area were found to contain residues of heptachlor and a derived chemical, heptachlor epoxide. Included among these fish were sunfish and bass, which of course are favorites of anglers and commonly find their way to the dinner table. Yet the chemicals they contained are among those the Food and Drug Administration considers too dangerous for human consumption, even in minute quantities. So extensive were the reported kills of fish, frogs, and other life of the waters that the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, a venerable scientific organization devoted to the study of fishes, reptiles, and amphibians, passed a resolution in 1958 calling on the Department of Agriculture and the associated state agencies to cease ‘aerial distribution of heptachlor, dieldrin, and equivalent poisons—before irreparable harm is done.’ The Society called attention to the great variety of species of fish and other forms of life inhabiting the southeastern part of the United States, including species that occur nowhere else in the world. ‘Many of these animals,’ the Society warned, ‘occupy only small areas and therefore might readily be completely exterminated.’ Fishes of the southern states have also suffered heavily from insecticides used against cotton insects. The summer of 1950 was a season of disaster in the cotton-growing country of northern Alabama. Before that year, only limited use had been made of organic insecticides for the control of the boll weevil. But in 1950 there were many weevils because of a series of mild winters, and so an estimated 80 to 95 per cent of the farmers, on the urging of the county agents, turned to the use of insecticides. The chemical most popular with the farmers was toxaphene, one of the most destructive to fishes. Rains were frequent and heavy that summer. They washed the chemicals into the streams, and as this happened the farmers applied more. An average acre of cotton that year received 63 pounds of toxaphene. Some farmers used as much as 200 pounds per acre; one, in an extraordinary excess of zeal, applied more than a quarter of a ton to the acre. The results could easily have been foreseen. What happened in Flint Creek, flowing through 50 miles of Alabama cotton country before emptying into Wheeler Reservoir, was typical of the region. On August 1, torrents of rain descended on the Flint Creek watershed. In trickles, in rivulets, and finally in floods the water poured off the land into the streams. The water level rose six inches in Flint Creek. By the next morning it was obvious that a great deal more than rain had been carried into the stream. Fish swam about in aimless circles near the surface. Sometimes one would throw itself out of the water onto the bank. They could easily be caught; one farmer picked up several and took them to a spring-fed pool. There, in the pure water, these few recovered. But in the stream dead fish floated down all day. This was but the prelude to more, for each rain washed more of the insecticide into the river, killing more fish. The rain of August 10 resulted in such a heavy fish kill throughout the river that few remained to become victims of the next surge of poison into the stream, which occurred on August 15. But evidence of the deadly presence of the chemicals was obtained by placing test goldfish in cages in the river; they were dead within a day. The doomed fish of Flint Creek included large numbers of white crappies, a favorite among anglers. Dead bass and sunfish were also found, occurring abundantly in Wheeler Reservoir, into which the creek flows. All the rough-fish population of these waters was destroyed also— the carp, buffalo, drum, gizzard shad, and catfish. None showed signs of disease—only the erratic movements of the dying and a strange deep wine color of the gills. In the warm enclosed waters of farm ponds, conditions are very likely to be lethal for fish when insecticides are applied in the vicinity. As many examples show, the poison is carried in by rains and runoff from surrounding lands. Sometimes the ponds receive not only contaminated runoff but also a direct dose as crop-dusting pilots neglect to shut off the duster in passing over a pond. Even without such complications, normal agricultural use subjects fish to far heavier concentrations of chemicals than would be required to kill them. In other words, a marked reduction in the poundages used would hardly alter the lethal situation, for applications of over 0.1 pound per acre to the pond itself are generally considered hazardous. And the poison, once introduced, is hard to get rid of. One pond that had been treated with DDT to remove unwanted shiners remained so poisonous through repeated drainings and flushings that it killed 94 per cent of the sunfish with which it was later stocked. Apparently the chemical remained in the mud of the pond bottom. Conditions are evidently no better now than when the modern insecticides first came into use. The Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Department stated in 1961 that reports of fish losses in farm ponds and small lakes had been coming in at the rate of at least one a week, and that such reports were increasing. The conditions usually responsible for these losses in Oklahoma were those made familiar by repetition over the years: the application of insecticides to crops, a heavy rain, and poison washed into the ponds. In some parts of the world the cultivation of fish in ponds provides an indispensable source of food. In such places the use of insecticides without regard for the effects on fish creates immediate problems. In Rhodesia, for example, the young of an important food fish, the Kafue bream, are killed by exposure to only 0.04 parts per million of DDT in shallow pools. Even smaller doses of many other insecticides would be lethal. The shallow waters in which these fish live are favorable mosquito-breeding places. The problem of controlling mosquitoes and at the same time conserving a fish important in the Central African diet has obviously not been solved satisfactorily. Milkfish farming in the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and India faces a similar problem. The milkfish is cultivated inshallow ponds along the coasts of these countries. Schools of young suddenly appear in the coastal waters (from no one knows where) and are scooped up and placed in impoundments, where they complete their growth. So important is this fish as a source of animal protein for the rice-eating millions of Southeast Asia and India that the Pacific Science Congress has recommended an international effort to search for the now unknown spawning grounds, in order to develop the farming of these fish on a massive scale. Yet spraying has been permitted to cause heavy losses in existing impoundments. In the Philippines aerial spraying for mosquito control has cost pond owners dearly. In one such pond containing 120,000 milkfish, more than half the fish died after a spray plane had passed over, in spite of desperate efforts by the owner to dilute the poison by flooding the pond. One of the most spectacular fish kills of recent years occurred in the Colorado River below Austin, Texas, in 1961. Shortly after daylight on Sunday morning, January 15, dead fish appeared in the new Town Lake in Austin and in the river for a distance of about 5 miles below the lake. None had been seen the day before. On Monday there were reports of dead fish 50 miles downstream. By this time it was clear that a wave of some poisonous substance was moving down in the river water. By January 21, fish were being killed 100 miles downstream near La Grange, and a week later the chemicals were doing their lethal work 200 miles below Austin. During the last week of January the locks on the Intracoastal Waterway were closed to exclude the toxic waters from Matagorda Bay and divert them into the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, investigators in Austin noticed an odor associated with the insecticides chlordane and toxaphene. It was especially strong in the discharge from one of the storm sewers. This sewer had in the past been associated with trouble from industrial wastes, and when officers of the Texas Game and Fish Commission followed it back from the lake, they noticed an odor like that of benzene hexachloride at all openings as far back as a feeder line from a chemical plant. Among the major products of this plant were DDT, benzene hexachloride, chlordane, and toxaphene, as well as smaller quantities of other insecticides. The manager of the plant admitted that quantities of powdered insecticide had been washed into the storm sewer recently and, more significantly, he acknowledged that such disposal of insecticide spillage and residues had been common practice for the past 10 years. On searching further, the fishery officers found other plants where rains or ordinary clean-up waters would carry insecticides into the sewer. The fact that provided the final link in the chain, however, was the discovery that a few days before the water in lake and river became lethal to fish the entire storm-sewer system had been flushed out with several million gallons of water under high pressure to clear it of debris. This flushing had undoubtedly released insecticides lodged in the accumulation of gravel, sand, and rubble and carried them into the lake and thence to the river, where chemical tests later established their presence. As the lethal mass drifted down the Colorado it carried death before it. For 140 miles downstream from the lake the kill of fish must have been almost complete, for when seines were used later in an effort to discover whether any fish had escaped they came up empty. Dead fish of 27 species were observed, totaling about 1000 pounds to a mile of riverbank. There were channel cats, the chief game fish of the river. There were blue and flathead catfish, bullheads, four species of sunfish, shiners, dace, stone rollers, largemouth bass, carp, mullet, suckers. There were eels, gar, carp, river carpsuckers, gizzard shad, and buffalo. Among them were some of the patriarchs of the river, fish that by their size must have been of great age—many flathead catfish weighing over 25 pounds, some of 60 pounds reportedly picked up by local residents along the river, and a giant blue catfish officially recorded as weighing 84 pounds. The Game and Fish Commission predicted that even without further pollution the pattern of the fish population of the river would be altered for years. Some species—those existing at the limits of their natural range—might never be able to re-establish themselves, and the others could do so only with the aid of extensive stocking operations by the state. This much of the Austin fish disaster is known, but there was almost certainly a sequel. The toxic river water was still possessed of its death-dealing power after passing more than 200 miles downstream. It was regarded as too dangerous to be admitted to the waters of Matagorda Bay, with its oyster beds and shrimp fisheries, and so the whole toxic outflow was diverted to the waters of the open Gulf. What were its effects there? And what of the outflow of scores of other rivers, carrying contaminants perhaps equally lethal? At present our answers to these questions are for the most part only conjectures, but there is growing concern about the role of pesticide pollution in estuaries, salt marshes, bays, and other coastal waters. Not only do these areas receive the contaminated discharge of rivers but all too commonly they are sprayed directly in efforts to control mosquitoes or other insects. Nowhere has the effect of pesticides on the life of salt marshes, estuaries, and all quiet inlets from the sea been more graphically demonstrated than on the eastern coast of Florida, in the Indian River country. There, in the spring of 1955, some 2000 acres of salt marsh in St. Lucie County were treated with dieldrin in an attempt to eliminate the larvae of the sandfly. The concentration used was one pound of active ingredient to the acre. The effect on the life of the waters was catastrophic. Scientists from the Entomology Research Center of the State Board of Health surveyed the carnage after the spraying and reported that the fish kill was ‘substantially complete’. Everywhere dead fishes littered the shores. From the air sharks could be seen moving in, attracted by the helpless and dying fishes in the water. No species was spared. Among the dead were mullets, snook, mojarras, gambusia. The minimum immediate overall kill throughout the marshes, exclusive of the Indian River shoreline, was 20-30 tons of fishes, or about 1,175,000 fishes, of atleast 30 species [reported R. W. Harrington, Jr. and W.L. Bidlingmayer of the survey team]. Mollusks seemed to be unharmed by dieldrin. Crustaceans were virtually exterminated throughout the area. The entire aquatic crab population was apparently destroyed and the fiddler crabs, all but annihilated, survived temporarily only in patches of marsh evidently missed by the pellets. The larger game and food fishes succumbed most rapidly...Crabs net upon and destroyed the moribund fishes, but the next day were dead themselves. Snails continued to devour fish carcasses. After two weeks, no trace remained of the litter of dead fishes. The same melancholy picture was painted by the late Dr. Herbert R. Mills from his observations in Tampa Bay on the opposite coast of Florida, where the National Audubon Society operates a sanctuary for seabirds in the area including Whiskey Stump Key. The sanctuary ironically became a poor refuge after the local health authorities undertook a campaign to wipe out the salt-marsh mosquitoes. Again fishes and crabs were the principal victims. The fiddler crab, that small and picturesque crustacean whose hordes move over mud flats or sand flats like grazing cattle, has no defense against the sprayers. After successive sprayings during the summer and fall months (some areas were sprayed as many as 16 times), the state of the fiddler crabs was summed up by Dr. Mills: ‘A progressive scarcity of fiddlers had by this time become apparent. Where there should have been in the neighborhood of 100,000 fiddlers under the tide and weather conditions of the day [October 12] there were not over 100 which could be seen anywhere on the beach, and these were all dead or sick, quivering, twitching, stumbling, scarcely able to crawl; although in neighboring unsprayed areas fiddlers were plentiful.’ The place of the fiddler crab in the ecology of the world it inhabits is a necessary one, not easily filled. It is an important source of food for many animals. Coastal raccoons feed on them. So do marsh-inhabiting birds like the clapper rail, shore- birds, and even visiting seabirds. In the New Jersey salt marsh sprayed with DDT, the normal population of laughing gulls was decreased by 85 per cent for several weeks, presumably because the birds could not find sufficient food after the spraying. The marsh fiddlers are important in other ways as well, being useful scavengers and aerating the mud of the marshes by their extensive burrowings. They also furnish quantities of bait for fishermen. The fiddler crab is not the only creature of tidal marsh and estuary to be threatened by pesticides; others of more obvious importance to man are endangered. The famous blue crab of the Chesapeake Bay and other Atlantic Coast areas is an example. These crabs are so highly susceptible to insecticides that every spraying of creeks, ditches, and ponds in tidal marshes kills most of the crabs living there. Not only do the local crabs die, but others moving into a sprayed area from the sea succumb to the lingering poison. And sometimes poisoning may be indirect, as in the marshes near Indian River, where scavenger crabs attacked the dying fishes, but soon themselves succumbed to the poison. Less is known about the hazard to the lobster. However, it belongs to the same group of arthropods as the blue crab, has essentially the same physiology, and would presumably suffer the same effects. This would be true also of the stone crab and other crustaceans which have direct economic importance as human food. The inshore waters—the bays, the sounds, the river estuaries, the tidal marshes—form an ecological unit of the utmost importance. They are linked so intimately and indispensably with the lives of many fishes, mollusks, and crustaceans that were they no longer habitable these seafoods would disappear from our tables. Even among fishes that range widely in coastal waters, many depend upon protected inshore areas to serve as nursery and feeding grounds for their young. Baby tarpon are abundant in all that labyrinth of mangrove-lined streams and canals bordering the lower third of the western coast of Florida. On the Atlantic Coast the sea trout, croaker, spot, and drum spawn on sandy shoals off the inlets between the islands or ‘banks’ that lie like a protective chain off much of the coast south of New York. The young fish hatch and are carried through the inlets by the tides. In the bays and sounds— Currituck, Pamlico, Bogue, and many others—they find abundant food and grow rapidly. Without these nursery areas of warm protected, food-rich waters the populations of these and many other species could not be maintained. Yet we are allowing pesticides to enter them via the rivers and by direct spraying over bordering marshlands. And the early stages of these fishes, even more than the adults, are especiallysusceptible to direct chemical poisoning. Shrimp, too, depend on inshore feeding grounds for their young. One abundant and widely ranging species supports the entire commercial fishery of the southern Atlantic and Gulf states. Although spawning occurs at sea, the young come into the estuaries and bays when a few weeks old to undergo successive molts and changes of form. There they remain from May or June until fall, feeding on the bottom detritus. In the entire period of their inshore life, the welfare of the shrimp populations and of the industry they support depends upon favorable conditions in the estuaries. Do pesticides represent a threat to the shrimp fisheries and to the supply for the markets? The answer may be contained in recent laboratory experiments carried out by the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. The insecticide tolerance of young commercial shrimp just past larval life was found to be exceedingly low—measured in parts per billion instead of the more commonly used standard of parts per million. For example, half the shrimp in one experiment were killed by dieldrin at a concentration of only 15 per billion. Other chemicals were even more toxic. Endrin, always one of the most deadly of the pesticides, killed half the shrimp at a concentration of only half of one part per billion. The threat to oysters and clams is multiple. Again, the young stages are most vulnerable. These shellfish inhabit the bottoms of bays and sounds and tidal rivers from New England to Texas and sheltered areas of the Pacific Coast. Although sedentary in adult life, they discharge their spawn into the sea, where the young are free-living for a period of several weeks. On a summer day a fine-meshed tow net drawn behind a boat will collect, along with the other drifting plant and animal life that make up the plankton, the infinitely small, fragile-as-glass larvae of oysters and clams. No larger than grains of dust, these transparent larvae swim about in the surface waters, feeding on the microscopic plant life of the plankton. If the crop of minute sea vegetation fails, the young shellfish will starve. Yet pesticides may well destroy substantial quantities of plankton. Some of the herbicides in common use on lawns, cultivated fields, and roadsides and even in coastal marshes are extraordinarily toxic to the plant plankton which the larval mollusks use as food—some at only a few parts per billion. The delicate larvae themselves are killed by very small quantities of many of the common insecticides. Even exposures to less than lethal quantities may in the end cause death of the larvae, for inevitably the growth rate is retarded. This prolongs the period the larvae must spend in the hazardous world of the plankton and so decreases the chance they will live to adulthood. For adult mollusks there is apparently less danger of direct poisoning, at least by some of the pesticides. This is not necessarily reassuring, however. Oysters and clams may concentrate these poisons in their digestive organs and other tissues. Both types of shellfish are normally eaten whole and sometimes raw. Dr. Philip Butler of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries has pointed out an ominous parallel in that we may find ourselves in the same situation as the robins. The robins, he reminds us, did not die as a direct result of the spraying of DDT. They died because they had eaten earthworms that had already concentrated the pesticides in their tissues. . . . Although the sudden death of thousands of fish or crustaceans in some stream or pond as the direct and visible effect of insect control is dramatic and alarming, these unseen and as yet largely unknown and unmeasurable effects of pesticides reaching estuaries indirectly in streams and rivers may in the end be more disastrous. The whole situation is beset with questions for which there are at present no satisfactory answers. We know that pesticides contained in runoff from farms and forests are now being carried to the sea in the waters of many and perhaps all of the major rivers. But we do not know the identity of all the chemicals or their total quantity, and we do not presently have any dependable tests for identifying them in highly diluted state once they have reached the sea. Although we know that the chemicals have almost certainly undergone change during the long period of transit, we do not know whether the altered chemical is more toxic than the original or less. Another almost unexplored area is the question of interactions between chemicals, a question that becomes especially urgent when they enter the marine environment where so many different minerals are subjected to mixing and transport. All of these questions urgently require the precise answers that only extensive research can provide, yet funds for such purposes are pitifullysmall. The fisheries of fresh and salt water are a resource of great importance, involving the interests and the welfare of a very large number of people. That they are now seriously threatened by the chemicals entering our waters can no longer be doubted. If we would divert to constructive research even a small fraction of the money spent each year on the development of ever more toxic sprays, we could find ways to use less dangerous materials and to keep poisons out of our waterways. When will the public become sufficiently aware of the facts to demand such action? 10. Indiscriminately from the Skies FROM SMALL BEGINNINGS over farmlands and forests the scope of aerial spraying has widened and its volume has increased so that it has become what a British ecologist recently called ‘an amazing rain of death’ upon the surface of the earth. Our attitude towards poisons has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not only the target insect or plant, but anything—human or nonhuman—within range of the chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well. A good many people now have misgivings about the aerial distribution of lethal chemicals over millions of acres, and two mass-spraying campaigns undertaken in the late 1950s have done much to increase these doubts. These were the campaigns against the gypsy moth in the northeastern states and the fire ant in the South. Neither is a native insect but both have been in this country for many years without creating a situation calling for desperate measures. Yet drastic action was suddenly taken against them, under the end-justifies-the-means",89290
Robin Wall Kimmerer,1,"people. She smiled kindly at him and instructed him to teach his people the gratitude and respect that they had forgotten. Only then would she return. He did as she asked and after a hard winter without corn, to remind them of the cost, she returned to them in the spring.* * This story is known from the southwest to the northeast. One version is told by Joseph Bruchac, in Caduto and Bruchac’s Keepers of Life. Several students in my audience yawned. They could not imagine such a thing. The aisles of the grocery store were always well stocked. At a reception afterward the students filled their Styrofoam plates with the usual fare. We exchanged questions and comments while we balanced plastic cups of punch. The students grazed on cheese and crackers, a profusion of cut vegetables, and buckets of dip. There was enough food to feast a small village. The leftovers were swept into trash bins placed conveniently next to the tables. A beautiful young girl, dark hair tied up in a headscarf, was hanging back from the discussion, waiting her turn. When nearly everyone had left she approached me, gesturing with an apologetic smile at the wasted remains of the reception. “I don’t want you to think no one understands what you were saying,” she said. “I do. You sound like my grandmother, back in my village in Turkey. I will tell her she must have a sister here in the United States. The Honorable Harvest is her way, too. In her house, we learned that everything we put in our mouths, everything that allows us to live, is the gift of another life. I remember lying with her at night as she made us thank the rafters of her house and the wool blankets we slept in. My grandma wouldn’t let us forget that these are all gifts, which is why you take care of everything, to show respect for that life. In my grandmother’s house we were taught to kiss the rice. If a single grain fell to the ground, we learned to pick it up and kiss it, to show we meant no disrespect in wasting it.” The student told me that, when she came to the United States, the greatest culture shock she experienced was not language or food or technology, but waste. “I’ve never told anyone before,“ she said, “but the cafeteria made me sick, because of the way people treated their food. What people throw away here after one lunch would supply my village for days. I could not speak to anyone of this; no one else would understand to kiss the grain of rice.” I thanked her for her story and she said, “Please, take it as a gift, and give it to someone else.” I’ve heard it said that sometimes, in return for the gifts of the earth, gratitude is enough. It is our uniquely human gift to express thanks, because we have the awareness and the collective memory to remember that the world could well be otherwise, less generous than it is. But I think we are called to go beyond cultures of gratitude, to once again become cultures of reciprocity. I met Carol Crowe, an Algonquin ecologist, at a meeting on indigenous models of sustainability. She told the story of requesting funding from her tribal council to attend the conference. They asked her, “What is this all about, this notion of sustainability? What are they talking about?” She gave them a summary of the standard definitions of sustainable development, including “the management of natural resources and social institutions in such a manner as to ensure the attainment and continued satisfaction of human needs for present and future generations.” They were quiet for a while, considering. Finally one elder said, “This sustainable development sounds to me like they just want to be able to keep on taking like they always have. It’s always about taking. You go there and tell them that in our way, our first thoughts are not ‘What can we take?’ but ‘What can we give to Mother Earth?’ That’s how it’s supposed to be.” The Honorable Harvest asks us to give back, in reciprocity, for what we have been given. Reciprocity helps resolve the moral tension of taking a life by giving in return something of value that sustains the ones who sustain us. One of our responsibilities as human people is to find ways to enter into reciprocity with the more-than-human world. We can do it through gratitude, through ceremony, through land stewardship, science, art, and in everyday acts of practical reverence. I have to confess that I’d shuttered my mind before I even met him. There was nothing a fur trapper could say that I wanted to hear. Berries, nuts, leeks, and, arguably, that deer who looks you in the eye, are all part of the matrix of the Honorable Harvest, but laying snares for snowy ermine and soft-footed lynx in order to adorn wealthy women is hard to justify. But I would certainly be respectful and listen. Lionel grew up in the north woods, hunting, fishing, guiding, making a living off the land in a remote log cabin, carrying on the tradition of the coureurs des bois. He learned trapping from his Indian grandfather who was renowned for his skills on the trapline. To catch a mink, you have to be able to think like a mink. His grandpa was a successful trapper because of his deep respect for the knowledge of the animals, where they traveled, how they hunted, where they would den up in bad weather. He could see the world through ermine eyes and so provided for his family. “I loved living in the bush,” Lionel says, “and I loved the animals.” Fishing and hunting gave the family their food; the trees gave them heat; and after their needs for warm hats and mittens were provided for, the furs they sold every year gave them cash for kerosene, coffee, beans, and school clothes. It was assumed that he would follow in the trade, but as a young man he refused. He wanted nothing more of trapping in the years when leg- hold traps became the norm. It was a cruel technology. He’d seen the animals who gnawed off their feet to free themselves. “Animals do have to die for us to live, but they don’t have to suffer,” he says. To stay in the bush he tried logging. He was practiced in the old methods for sledding out timber in the winter along an ice road, felling while the snow blanket protected the earth. But the old, low-impact practices had given way to big machines that ripped up the forest and wrecked the land his animals needed. The dark forest turned to ragged stumps, the clear streams to muddy trenches. He tried to work in the cab of the D9 Cat, and a feller-buncher, a machine designed to take it all. But he couldn’t do it. Then Lionel went to work in the mines at Sudbury, Ontario, left the woods to work underground, digging nickel ore from the earth to be fed into the maw of furnaces. Sulfur dioxide and heavy metals poured from the stacks, making a toxic acid rain that killed every living thing for miles, a gigantic burn mark on the land. Without vegetation, the soil all washed away, leaving a moonscape so bare that NASA used it to test lunar vehicles. The metal smelters at Sudbury held the earth in a leg-hold trap, and the forest was dying a slow and painful death. Too late, after the damage was done, Sudbury became the poster child for clean-air legislation. There is no shame in working the mines to feed your family—an exchange of hard labor in return for food and shelter—but you want your labor to count for something more. Driving home each night through the moonscape his labor created, he felt blood on his hands, and so he quit. Today Lionel spends his winter days on snowshoes on his trapline and winter nights preparing furs. Unlike the harsh chemicals of the factory, brain tanning yields the softest, most durable hide. He says with wonder in his voice and a soft moose hide on his lap, “There is just enough in each animal’s brain to tan its own hide.” His own brain and his heart led him back home to the woods. Lionel is of the Métis Nation; he calls himself “a blue-eyed Indian,” raised in the deep woods of northern Quebec, as his melodious accent suggests. His conversation is so delightfully sauced with “Oui, oui, madame” that I imagine he will kiss my hand at any moment. His own hands are telling: woodsman’s hands broad and strong enough to set a trap or a logging chain but sensitive enough to stroke a pelt to gauge its thickness. By the time we spoke, leg-hold traps had been banned in Canada and only body-hold traps that ensure a sudden death were permitted. He demonstrates one: it takes two strong arms to open and set, and its powerful snap would break a neck in an instant. Trappers spend more time on the land than anyone else these days, and they maintain detailed records of their harvest. Lionel keeps a thickly penciled notebook in his vest pocket; he takes it out and waves it, saying, “Wanna see my new BlackBerry? I just download my data to my bush computer, runs on propane, don’t you know.” His traplines yield beaver, lynx, coyote, fisher, mink, and ermine. He runs his hand over the pelts, explaining about the density of the winter undercoat and the long guard hairs, how you can judge the health of an animal by its fur. He pauses when he comes to martens, whose pelage is legendary in its silky-soft luxury—the American sable. It is beautifully colored and feather light. Martens are part of Lionel’s life here—they’re his neighbors and he is thankful that they have rebounded from near extirpation. Trappers like him are on the front line of monitoring wildlife populations and well-being. They have a responsibility to take care of the species they rely upon, and every visit to the trapline produces data that govern the trapper’s response. “If we catch only male martens, we will keep the traps open,” he says. When there is an excess of unpaired males, they are wandering and easy to trap. Too many young males can leave less food for the others. “But as soon as we get a female, we stop trapping. That means we’ve skimmed off the excess and we don’t touch the rest. That way the population doesn’t get too crowded, none will go hungry, but their population will continue to grow.” In late winter, when the snow is still heavy but the days are lengthening, Lionel drags down the ladder from the rafters in his garage. He straps on his snowshoes and stomps out into the bush with the ladder on his shoulder and hammer, nails, and scrap wood in his pack basket. He scouts out just the right spots: big old trees with cavities are best, as long as the size and shape of the hole dictates that only a single species can use it. He climbs to where the ladder, anchored in the snow, leans against a high branch and he constructs a platform. He makes it home before dark and rises the next day to do it again. It’s hard work lugging a ladder through the woods. When he’s done with the platforms, he pulls a white plastic pail from the freezer and sets it by the woodstove to thaw. All summer long Lionel serves as a fishing guide on the remote lakes and rivers of his birth. He jokes that he works for only himself now and he calls his company See More and Do Less. Not a bad business plan. When he and his “sports” clean their catch he scrapes the guts into big white pails and keeps them in his freezer. He overheard his clients whispering, “Must be he eats fish-gut stew in the winter.” The next day he’s off again, pulling the bucket on a sled, miles down the trapline. At every platform tree, he scrambles up the ladder, with somewhat less grace than a weasel, one-handed. (You don’t want to slop fish guts all over yourself.) He shovels out a big smelly scoop onto each platform and then hikes off to the next. Like many predators, martens are slow reproducers, which makes them vulnerable to decline, especially when they’re exploited. Gestation is about nine months, and they don’t give birth until they’re three years old. They’ll have from one to four young and raise only as many as the food supply allows. “I put out the gut piles in the last weeks before the little mothers give birth,” Lionel says. “If you put them where nothing else can get them, those mothers will have some extra-good meals. That will help them to nurse their babies so more will survive, especially if we get a late snow or something.” The tenderness in his voice makes me think of a neighbor delivering a warm casserole to a shut-in. It’s not how I’ve thought of trappers. “Well,” he says, blushing a little, “dose little martens take care of me and I take care of dem.” The teachings tell us that a harvest is made honorable by what you give in return for what you take. There is no escaping the fact that Lionel’s care will result in more martens on his trapline. There is no escaping the fact that they will also be killed. Feeding mama martens is not altruism; it is deep respect for the way the world works, for the connections between us, of life flowing into life. The more he gives, the more he can take, and he goes the extra mile to give more than he takes. I’m moved by Lionel’s affection and respect for these animals, for the care that flows from his intimate knowledge of their needs. He lives the tension of loving his prey and resolves it for himself by practicing the tenets of the Honorable Harvest. But there is also no escaping the fact that the marten pelts are likely to become a luxury coat for a very wealthy person, perhaps the owner of the Sudbury mine. These animals will die by his hand, but first they will live well, in part by his hand. His lifestyle, which I had condemned without understanding, protects the forest, protects the lakes and rivers, not just for him and the furbearers, but for all the forest beings. A harvest is made honorable when it sustains the giver as well as the taker. And today Lionel is also a gifted teacher, invited to schools far and wide to share his traditional knowledge of wildlife and conservation. He is giving back what was given to him. It’s hard for the guy wearing the sable in the corner office of Sudbury to imagine Lionel’s world, to even conceive of a way of living that would require him to consider taking only what he needs, to give back in reciprocity for what he takes, to nurture the world that nurtures him, to carry meals to a nursing mother in a wild treetop den. But unless we want more wastelands, he needs to learn. These may seem like charming anachronisms, rules for hunting and gathering whose relevance vanished along with the buffalo. But remember that the buffalo are not extinct and in fact are making a resurgence under the care of those who remember. The canon of the Honorable Harvest is poised to make its comeback, too, as people remember that what’s good for the land is also good for the people. We need acts of restoration, not only for polluted waters and degraded lands, but also for our relationship to the world. We need to restore honor to the way we live, so that when we walk through the world we don’t have to avert our eyes with shame, so that we can hold our heads up high and receive the respectful acknowledgment of the rest of the earth’s beings. I feel lucky to have wild leeks, dandelion greens, marsh marigolds, and hickory nuts—if I get there before the squirrels do. But these are decorations on a diet that comes mostly from my garden and from the grocery store, like everyone else, especially now that more people live in urban centers than the countryside. Cities are like the mitochondria in our animal cells—they are consumers, fed by the autotrophs, the photosynthesis of a distant green landscape. We could lament that urban dwellers have little means of exercising direct reciprocity with the land. Yet while city folks may be separated from the sources of what they consume, they can exercise reciprocity through how they spend their money. While the digging of the leeks and the digging of the coal may be too far removed to see, we consumers have a potent tool of reciprocity right in our pockets. We can use our dollars as the indirect currency of reciprocity. Perhaps we can think of the Honorable Harvest as a mirror by which we judge our purchases. What do we see in the mirror? A purchase worthy of the lives consumed? Dollars become a surrogate, a proxy for the harvester with hands in the earth, and they can be used in support of the Honorable Harvest—or not. It’s easy to make this argument, and I believe that the principles of the Honorable Harvest have great resonance in an era when overconsumption threatens every dimension of our well-being. But it can be too easy to shift the burden of responsibility to the coal company or the land developers. What about me, the one who buys what they sell, who is complicit in the dishonorable harvest? I live in the country, where I grow a big garden, get eggs from my neighbor’s farm, buy apples from the next valley over, pick berries and greens from my few rewilding acres. A lot of what I own is secondhand, or third. The desk that I’m writing on was once a fine dining table that someone set out on the curb. But while I heat with wood, compost and recycle, and do myriad other responsible things, if I did an honest inventory of my household, most of it would probably not make the grade of the Honorable Harvest. I want to do the experiment, to see if one can subsist in this market economy and still practice the rules of the Honorable Harvest. So I take my shopping list and go forth. Actually, our local grocery store makes it pretty easy to be mindful of the choices and the mantra of mutual benefit for land and people. They’ve partnered with farmers for local organic goods at a price normal people can afford. They’re big on “green” and recycled products, too, so I can hold my toilet paper purchase up to the mirror of the Honorable Harvest without flinching. When I walk the aisles with open eyes, the source of the food is mostly evident, although Cheetos and Ding Dongs remain an ecological mystery. For the most part, I can use dollars as the currency of good ecological choices, alongside my questionable but persistent need for chocolate. I don’t have much patience with food proselytizers who refuse all but organic, free-range, fair-trade gerbil milk. We each do what we can; the Honorable Harvest is as much about the relationships as about the materials. A friend of mine says she buys just one green item a week— that’s all she can do, so she does it. “I want to vote with my dollar,” she says. I can make choices because I have the disposable income to choose “green” over less-expensive goods, and I hope that will drive the market in the right direction. In the food deserts of the South Side there is no such choice, and the dishonor in that inequity runs far deeper than the food supply. I am stopped in my tracks in the produce section. There on a Styrofoam tray, sheathed in plastic and tagged at the princely sum of $15.50 per pound, are Wild Leeks. The plastic presses down on them: they look trapped and suffocated. Alarm bells go off in my head, alarms of commoditization of what should be regarded as a gift and all the dangers that follow from that kind of thinking. Selling leeks makes them into mere objects and cheapens them, even at $15.50 per pound. Wild things should not be for sale. Next stop is the mall, a place I try to avoid at all costs, but today I will go into the belly of the beast in service to my experiment. I sit in the car for a few minutes trying to rouse the same attunement and outlook with which I go to the woods, receptive, observant, and grateful, but I’ll be gathering a new stock of paper and pens instead of wild leeks. There is a stone wall to cross here, too, the three-story edifice of the mall, bordered by another lifeless field of parking lot, with crows perched on the stanchions. As I cross the wall, the floor is hard beneath my feet and heels click on the faux-marble tile. I pause to take in the sounds. Inside, there are neither crows nor wood thrushes, but rather a soundtrack of strangely sanitized oldies set to strings, hovering above the drone of the ventilation system. The light is dim fluorescent with spotlights to dapple the floor, the better to highlight the splashes of color which identify the shops, their logos as readily identifiable as patches of bloodroot across the forest. Like in the spring woods, the air is a patchwork of scents that I walk among: coffee here, cinnamon buns there, a shop of scented candles, and beneath it all the pervasive tang of fast-food Chinese from the food court. At the end of the wing, I spy the habitat of my quarry. I navigate easily, as I’ve been coming here for years for my traditional harvest of writing supplies. At the store entrance is a stack of bright red plastic shopping bins with metal handles. I pick one up and again become the woman with the basket. In the paper aisle I am confronted with a great diversity of species of paper—wide ruled and narrow, copier paper, stationery, spiral bound, loose-leaf—arrayed in clonal patches by brand and purpose. I see just what I want, my favorite legal pads, as yellow as a downy violet. I stand before them trying to conjure the gathering mentality, to bring all the rules of the Honorable Harvest to bear, but I can’t do it without the bite of mockery. I try to sense the trees in that stack of paper and address my thoughts to them, but the taking of their lives is so far removed from this shelf that there is just a distant echo. I think about the harvesting method: were they clear-cut? I think about the stink of the paper mill, the effluent, the dioxin. Fortunately, there is a stack labeled “Recycled,” so I choose those, paying a little more for the privilege. I pause and consider whether the yellow dyed may be worse than the white bleached. I have my suspicions, but I choose the yellow as I always do. It looks so nice with green or purple ink, like a garden. I wander next to the pen aisle, or as they call it, “writing instruments.” The choices here are even more numerous and I have no idea at all where they came from, except some petrochemical synthesis. How can I bring honor to this purchase, use my dollars as the currency of honor when the lives behind the product are invisible? I stand there so long that an “associate” comes to ask if I’m looking for anything in particular. I guess I look like a shoplifter planning a heist of “writing instruments” with my little red basket. I’d like to ask him, “Where did these things come from? What are they made of and which one was made with a technology that inflicts minimal damage on the earth? Can I buy pens with the same mentality with which a person digs wild leeks?” But I suspect he would call security on the little earpiece attached to his jaunty store cap, so I just choose my favorite, for the feel of the nib against the paper and the purple and green ink. At the checkout I engage in reciprocity, tendering my credit card in return for writing supplies. Both the clerk and I say thank you, but not to the trees. I’m trying hard to make this work, but what I feel in the woods, the pulsing animacy, is simply not here. I realize why the tenets of reciprocity don’t work here, why this glittering labyrinth seems to make a mockery of the Honorable Harvest. It’s so obvious, but I didn’t see it, so intent was I on searching for the lives behind the products. I couldn’t find them because the lives aren’t here. Everything for sale here is dead. I get a cup of coffee and sit on a bench to watch the scene unfold, gathering evidence as best I can, notebook open in my lap. Sullen teenagers wanting to buy their self hood and sad-looking old men sitting alone at the food court. Even the plants are plastic. I’ve never been shopping like this before, with such intentional awareness of what goes on here. I suppose I’ve blocked it out in my usual hurry to get in, make my purchase, and get out. But now I scan the landscape with all senses heightened. Open to the T-shirts, the plastic earrings, and the iPods. Open to shoes that hurt, delusions that hurt, and mountains of needless stuff that hurts the chances that my grandchildren will have a good green earth to care for. It hurts me even to bring the ideas of the Honorable Harvest here; I feel protective of them. I want to cup them like a small warm animal in my hands and shelter them from the onslaught of their antithesis. But I know they are stronger than this. It’s not the Honorable Harvest that is the aberration, though—it is this marketplace. As leeks cannot survive in a cutover forest, the Honorable Harvest cannot survive in this habitat. We have constructed an artifice, a Potemkin village of an ecosystem where we perpetrate the illusion that the things we consume have just fallen off the back of Santa’s sleigh, not been ripped from the earth. The illusion enables us to imagine that the only choices we have are between brands. Back home I wash away the last bits of black soil and trim the long white roots. One big handful of leeks we set aside, unwashed. The girls chop the slender bulbs and the leaves, and they all go into my favorite cast iron skillet with way more butter than a person should probably have. The aroma of sautéed leeks fills the kitchen. Just breathing it in is good medicine. The sharp pungency dissipates quickly and the fragrance that lingers is deep and savory, with a hint of leaf mold and rainwater. Potato leek soup, wild leek risotto, or just a bowl of leeks are nourishment for body and soul. When my daughters leave on Sunday, I’m happy to know that something of their childhood woods will travel with them. After dinner, I take the basket of unwashed leeks to the tiny patch of forest above my pond to plant them. The harvesting process now unfolds in reverse. I ask permission to bring them here, to open the earth for their arrival. I search out the rich moist hollows and tuck them into the soil, emptying my basket instead of filling it. These woods are second or third growth and sadly lost their leeks long ago. It turns out that when forests around here grow back after agricultural clearing, the trees come back readily but the understory plants do not. From a distance the new postagricultural woods look healthy; the trees came back thick and strong. But inside something is missing. The April showers do not bring May flowers. No trillium, no mayapple, no bloodroot. Even after a century of regrowth, the postfarming forests are impoverished, while the untilled forests just across the wall are an explosion of blossoms. The medicines are missing, for reasons ecologists do not yet understand. It might be microhabitat, it might be dispersal, but it is clear that the original habitat for these old medicines was obliterated in a cascade of unintended consequences as the land was turned to corn. The land is no longer hospitable for the medicines and we don’t know why. The Skywoman woods across the valley have never been plowed, so they still have their full glory, but most other woods are missing their forest floor. Leek-laden woods have become a rarity. Left to time and chance alone, my cutover woods would probably never recover their leeks or their trillium. The way I see it, it’s up to me to carry them over the wall. Over the years, this replanting on my hillside has yielded small patches of vibrant green in April and nurtures the hope that the leeks can return to their homelands and that when I’m an old lady I’ll have a celebratory spring supper close at hand. They give to me, I give to them. Reciprocity is an investment in abundance for both the eater and the eaten. We need the Honorable Harvest today. But like the leeks and the marten, it is an endangered species that arose in another landscape, another time, from a legacy of traditional knowledge. That ethic of",138790
Val Plumwood,1,"life, in favour of a distant abstract ideal or heaven which leaves everything drained of light, life and beauty. It makes the colours duller and destroys one’s receptivity to beauty. Australia with its cultural cringe has, like other settler colonies suffered badly from this syndrome. Despite the wildflower glory, I puzzled about whether the landscape I experienced daily conformed to proper ideals of beauty. It didn’t look at all like the pictures my aunties had on their walls, the idealised mountains, parks and formal gardens of the distant place that I still heard spoken of as ‘home’. Australians of those times complained often about the endless grey bush and its inexhaustible dullness and monotony, still often looking to a half-remembered Europe for visions of beauty. My third generation parents had gone part-way towards breaking with these colonial values, and I was taught to enjoy and admire the bush, and not to pick the wildflowers or harm the creatures. Yet some unconscious baggage from my cultural milieu remained an obstacle to full and public afirmation of my surroundings. Yetmostlythesensuousrichnessoftheforestworldaroundmewasanoverwhelming joy, immediate and undeniable, that won out against this thief of the moment’s joy. In summer the forest unfolded its ecstasy of creamy, honey-scented myrtle blossom, dwarf apple, bloodwood and Kunzea, to delight the nose and drive the beetles wild. The nectar-filled Banksia candles were there for the honeyeaters each autumn, burning orange brilliant as the sun foretold winter sunsets. From August onwards, white Tick Bush, pink Boronias and Waxflowers, red Grevilleas and the well-timed Christmas Bells were a feast for the eye, each with its retinue of birds and insects thirsting for a piece of the action. This was a reproduction-centred world, the work it seemed, of an imagination of great fertility entirely uninhibited by any taboos about cross-species sex. Like Alice who goes sailing, dreaming among the rushes, among the pink, white and blue waterlilies which she picks, I lived a little girl’s dream of a world where even the stones might speak, where animals and plants spoke and were all active forces in life. This world was a lover. Nature was full of presences, presences such as the lyre bird, a bird lover calling through the forest, with his rivals calling up the powers of the forest. And so somehow during these childhood wanderings I learnt to think of the world like this, as a lover, and I acquired an unquenchable thirst for life, for the wisdom of the land. An enriching perspective but perhaps incautious. Perhaps this background explains in part why I met the crocodile like a child who has just become aware of the evil in the world, a sharply demonic experience of some great wrong done to another. 41 The Eye of the Crocodile In earlier puritan times, nature was pushed away and seen as an evil animal realm in which civilised rules and practices were abandoned in favour of wholesale licence. Nature from this perspective was the wild, threatening female other who must be brought under control and harnessed in the garden. The garden was depicted, by this suspicious, civilising and crusading culture, as the realm of collaborators and domesticated things around the house. It existed in opposition to the realm of the wild. This is an outlook that decides that, rather than deal with the dangerous things out there that could cause you a moment’s inconvenience or even something as terrifying as a mosquito bite, it is preferable to stay within the comfort zone and forget about the rest. The result is that we are now faced with answering the question of what our relationship with the wild must be. Can there really be such a thing as the old regime, the old order of the world with its evolutionary time? Surely there is a real point in solidarity with that world, that vivid world of sharp colours, of quickening pulse, that comes into focus again when you know that the next moments and your decisions in those next few moments will decide your life or death. That is something that sends you spinning through the tunnel at a frightening speed to arrive with a very big bump, a terrible bump, in the parallel universe. For in the death moment we are reclaimed once again by the sphere of nature, of death as nature, and especially so when we die by a predator of nature—as do the other beings we have said are not of our sphere. But we can only comprehend all this through our cultural understandings. Culture, therefore, has a very big and responsible role to play. First, we should certainly stop expecting an old man with a white beard to hold our hand and guarantee us a world where we all get just what we deserve. Equally we need to stop telling elaborate and patently ridiculous stories about the problem of evil and how it was sent to test us and save the day, or take us away into a better world somewhere else that will look after us and soothe our every want and which will make up for all the injustices of this one. These ideas bear no resemblance to the actual ecological world we live in. It is time we faced up to the fact that we’re here and we must try to tell a story that brings the two worlds into some greater congruence and balance. What sort of story would we have to tell to create a crocodile narrative as a narrative of justice? That is the key question—what sort of story would you have to tell to bring the two worlds together? To be able to see into each from the other one, not to experience that alarming doubleness of the duck-rabbit— now we can see this way, but not that. Rather than a sort of blindness we need to develop a double vision. The need to explain my own lack of consciousness of the two worlds led me to re-examine the denial of materiality or corporeality in Western culture. My 42 3. The wisdom of the balanced rock: The parallel universe and the prey perspective reaction to the crocodile showed me I was not fully liberated from the influence of the ideology common to white Western inhabitants of ‘culture’. Although humankind is known to have evolved from the same genetic stock as all other primates and to be closely related to all living things we endlessly engage in activities and beliefs that seem to minimise our connections to other animals. My dramatic entry into the Heraclitean universe opened my eyes and made me acutely aware that we are not in fact different from other animals but material beings vulnerable to death and decay. By keeping ourselves separate from, and ignorant of, this other universe, we maintain a distinction that provides protection from deeply rooted anxieties about mortality and our supposedly superior human status. By imagining that we live solely within culture we can allow ourselves to think that our lives count more than the lives of other physical beings. At base, it is our bodies that we find a particular problem because, unlike our minds, they remind us of our animal limitations. So what sort of story would enable us to connect the two universes, to interweave them at the level of personal and immediate life as well as social life? It seems to me thattheingrainedmind/bodydualisminWesternculturepreventsusfromknowing the story of our ecological embeddedness in any way except as it were distantly and at some great remove, in the abstract manner of narrative science or in the same kind of way I discover facts about the state of outer space or Uranus. Normally it seems as if our culture is so constructed that we live in one of these worlds and just know about the other via this removed, abstract kind of knowledge or through an occasional visit to the summer wonderland aspect of nature. In other words, we live our lives in a human-made world of culture and we define ourselves in terms of human justice. We forget that our lives of culture grew out of the older world that has somehow now floated clear from it—or so it thinks—except that occasionally there are line breaks, interruptions to transmissions, and recently some of the system alarms have been going off at regular intervals. But we have long ago stopped paying much attention to the dials that tell us what is going on in the ‘other’ system because we are engaged in a competitive game played among a large human population, a scramble for survival in a gigantic machine that runs on the rationality of maximising and concentrating property formation. So we are not looking in that direction, although occasionally another breakdown forces itself on our attention and causes us to cast a glance back at the dials. It is especially at the point of death and food that the two systems converge on a personal level. So there is an obvious need for a guiding narrative, or better, a set of narratives which reposition us personally in nature. These must also operate at the economic level. They cannot be simply stories of ‘visiting’ the other domain, of being a summer good-time girl holidaying briefly in nature before returning to the ‘proper’ sphere of culture. 43 The Eye of the Crocodile We are in desperate need of stories that create much greater transparency of these relationships in our day-to-day lives. We must once again become a culture of stories—stories that link our lives with the Great Life which some call Gaia, but all should call by names of their own devising. This is the real meaning of ecological literacy, to have stories that speak of the culture/nature boundary and of where the two cultures meet. Instead we have one discourse about the domain of culture (us) and another discourse, formulated in an especially detached and distant way, about the domain of nature (them). Our conviction that ‘we’ live in culture and ‘they’ live in nature is so strong that all that is left is a passionate story about consciousness, history and freedom—about us—and another story about fiercely uninvolved causation and clockwork—a story about them. The dualistic Christian/Western framework of alienation and material denial has erased our connecting narratives at a number of key meeting points. I am here concerned specifically with those of food and death but there are others that also create dead areas or voids, places of insensitivity where we have no contact structures and no useful guiding stories. The Western dualistic construction which proclaims separate and never meeting realms continues to hinder these crucial constructions and connections. It allows us to deny grief and mourning for the suffering that animals such as wombats endure in severe drought conditions. I cannot ignore the grief I feel for animals that I have picked up injured or dying—the glimpse of their perfection and the knowledge that they are dying—the robin thrown onto the ground at my feet whose yellow and grey perfection I could only gasp at with grief and contrition as it died slowly in my cupped hands. Or there was the fairy penguin I found washed ashore on a Tasmanian beach, dead from starvation due to waves of disease spread throughout the local pilchard population (a main food source for fairy penguins) by foreign pilchards imported to provide food for farmed salmon. We know that such animals are individuals who often value and know themselves as such and it is important that we should do the same. The polarity between nature and culture is of the type Marilyn Frye discusses in terms of the feminist project. She argues that it is necessary to move beyond a concept of woman as ‘deficient male’ to the idea of woman as ‘positively-other-than’. What is at stake here is whether current, environmental categories are interpreted as inclusive instead of overlapping. Wecannotignorethefactthatallourfoodissouls.Inmyopinion,itismisguidedto followtheexampleofvegetarianimperialistswhoaimtoeliminateanyensouledfood byinsistingthatonlynon-ensouledfoodcanbeeaten.Thisplacingofourselvesoutside the food chain and the exchange of reciprocity in food and death and then trying to impose this on other cultures is a dangerous denial. Such alienated vegetarianism has a direct relationship with the dualism of Descartes and the Cartesian separation of moral orders. It equates culture with consciousness and nature with clockwork 44 mechanisms devoid of feeling and governed solely by instinct. 3. The wisdom of the balanced rock: The parallel universe and the prey perspective It is this attitude that allows us to treat our food so badly. The factory farmed animal has already been desouled in advance and constructed as future food. The animal becomes just the living end of the production line; it’s just meat, mere denigrated, lowly matter. We cannot admit we are eating souls. How can our food be sacred in the way described by Gary Snyder at the start of this chapter if we view ourselves and it through these lenses? I believe vegetarianism in this alienated form is also the product of this mindset. Despite the main message of ecology that we live in both worlds there remains a great deal of conflict around these issues among environmentalists. I believe this is because we have eliminated the stories that connect the two realms due to our alienated conceptions of the key events in human life where the culture/ nature stories come together. What is holding us up from resisting this piece of imperialism is the insistence on not construing the ecological sphere as a sphere of justice. We need to employ a richer understanding of ethics that gives an important place to emotionality and particularity.JimCheneyhasindicatedwaysinwhichthismightbedevelopedby arguing for stories in which the use of metaphor is an apt vehicle for introducing new conceptions of theory and the self, or knowledge and the knower. Justice in the ecological sphere has tough rules that we have shown great resistance to accepting. It consists of a very radical egalitarian framework in which you have your little piece of life force for just so long as it’s not wanted by another. These are the Heraclitean rules where your body does not belong to you. There is no delineationofanindividualjusticeframework.However,fromthestandpointofa human justice system that doesn’t mean we must ourselves treat the whole thing, the more-than-human world in the same way. We are not solely nature and quite a lot of localised parts of ‘nature’ work in accordance with a sense of individual value. It is a fallacy to assume that we cannot mix realms. What is crucial is to do so in non-appropriative ways. It is possible to make different rules that we will care about and consider individuals where it is appropriate. We know for example, that crocodiles value individuals in ways that are similar to our own story. There is no reason why we cannot adopt their own standards as a mark of respect for this localised community and for the larger system that allows it to thrive. The alienated vegetarian, I believe, does not admit more than one standard and construes the animal predator as simply outside ethics rather than an operator in a different ethical framework. To see the predator as outside ethics requires positioning them as ethical non-actors—like a child or disadvantaged human categories we do not treat well. If they are not so positioned, they must be seen in an even worse light as an evil character. *** Editor’s note: Sadly,thischapterwasincompleteatthetimeofValPlumwood’sdeath. 45 Second section 47 4. A wombat wake: In memoriam Birubi My wombat Birubi died after a brief illness sometime around Wednesday 18 August 1999. I miss Birubi greatly and continue to catch his beloved form (or ‘ghost’) out of the corner of my eye, a half-seen image flitting around the corner of a cupboard or across the veranda. Long after his death, my eyes continued to search out his shape on the moonlit grass. He was part of my life for so long— over twelve years—that I found it hard to believe he would no longer wait for me or greet me, that he was finally gone. We had a wake for him a few days later. The idea of the wake was to focus on his life rather than his death, to honour presence rather than mourn absence, and to celebrate and express gratitude for Birubi’s life and for wombat life more generally. We had a small ceremony for him, and told many Birubi stories and wombat stories generally. Many of the people who helped care for Birubi over the years when I was working overseas or in distant parts of Australia were present with their own experiences and thoughts to contribute. The wake was far from being a dismal occasion. Birubi had a full and whole wombat life and died what seemed to be a dignified and peaceful wombat death. He came to the house for sanctuary in his final months and often rested or slept in front of the fire, but returned to his burrow, snug pouch of mother earth, in his last hours. Birubi came to me from the wildlife rescue service as a malnourished and very sick orphan. His mother had probably died of the mange, a disease introduced by Europeans with their dogs that brings so many wombats to an early and tormented death. Since my own human son had recently died, Birubi and I bonded strongly. Birubi (the name, meaning I believe ‘the drum’, was given him by his first carers in the rescue service) was about a year old, furred but still suckling, when he took up residence with me. He seemed to have suffered greatly from his mother’s death and was desperate for care. Birubi had received from his wombat mother a good quality wombat education; she had taught him to defecate outside the burrow (or its equivalent, my house), and the rudiments of survival in the bush. Within a day of arriving he learnt to open the sliding glass doors of the house and could go outside into the bush whenever he wished (which was often). His ability to control the access between his world and mine enabled him to be active in choosing and structuring the balance between us, to enter my world while still fully retaining his wombatness. He was generally wary of humans until he had clearly established their identity, and would exit the house if it was too noisy or unsettling. Birubi grew to belong to both the world of the house and that of the forest, supposedly exclusive and mutually oppositional. He needed a lot of medical 49 The Eye of the Crocodile treatment and supplementary feeding for the first year, so he became accustomed to the house and knew something of its comforts. But from the beginning he was based primarily out of doors in various holes he selected or renovated, and always preferred that world. Once established in his own nearby burrows in the forest, he came to the house on a visiting basis on the average for an hour or so most evenings for personal, moral and material support. (At his behest I supplemented his grazing with carrots and rolled oats, which corresponded to the roots and seeds sections of the wombat diet). In the first year he would spend part of the night out of doors, and part in my bed with me. He initiated all these high contact arrangements, and would not easily be turned aside from them, (although since wombats are nocturnal, they often led to me getting inadequate sleep). Sometimes I had to exclude him by locking the doors if he became too demanding of my time or arrived at very unreasonable hours. To sleep next to me was his ardent desire, but it presented some dificulties. It was wise to get the leeches and ticks off him before letting him into the bed if you wanted a comfortable rest. After I had got into bed, he would come over and start biting its edge furiously until I gave him a hand up. Once in bed, he would usually lie down next to me on his side and drop off like a light. I can attest that during sleep he often ground his teeth and also vocalised in ways that suggested the imaginary encounters of dreaming. Usually he would wake up again about two hours later and go outside to graze, (and of course I was then obliged to get up to close the door he left open in case dangerous or unsuitable animals entered). Since he was a skilful door and cupboard opener, Birubi had to be locked out of the house when there was nobody else there. There are many stories about what happened when Birubi got into the house without supervision. He was very skilful with his mouth, which he used for manipulation and encounter, and enjoyed opening and exploring food packages and biting hard furniture and soft stuffed things. His tastes are commemorated around my house on cushions, chairs, stools, hassocks and cupboard doors. Birubi was a vigorous player of various wombat chasing and hiding games he began to teach me as soon as he recovered his strength. These games seemed to me (there is of course much uncertainty here) to roll together features of play, love and war. He played very rough by human standards, but I do not think that he really intended to hurt—it’s probably just that wombats are tougher, especially around the ankles, his favourite nipping point when he caught you. He was a skilful game player who expected to win, would sulk if he did not, and had learnt the eficacy of feinting. When young, Birubi would have been happy I think to play games all day, but fortunately this desire waned a bit as he grew older. Even as an older wombat, though, he showed that he liked a game and had a sense of humour. 50 4. A wombat wake: In memoriam Birubi I was always conscious of a dimension of mystery in my knowledge of Birubi’s mind. The sense of bridging a great gulf of difference was part of the magic of the relationship. I think it was the centrality of the mother–child relationship to both our species and what was shared in its framework of ethics and expectations that made possible intimate contact with a creature so very different. This kind of relationship is necessarily cast in communicative terms that disrupt the severely restricted vocabulary for describing animal behaviour and interaction allowed by reductionist science and its objectivist ideals of non-relationship or its near approximation, subject–object relationship. Although you could entertain a large range of hypotheses about the meaning, complexity and specificity of his responses, that relationship, plus your knowledge of context and past interactions, usually suggested some credible and reasonably lucid tale about the other’s mental processes and attitudes that enabled you to continue relating as co-actors in a partially shared narrative of the world. There were times, especially when he was an adolescent testing out his power, when I felt my relationship with him was balanced on a knife edge, but as he matured it took on a less precarious form. Birubi, like other wombats and unlike dogs, was a resilient and determined animal who could not be shaped to human will. He did not recognise human superiority or pretensions to own the world and had a strong sense of his own independent selfhood, his own equal interests and entitlements. This stubbornness and sense of equality is the feature that has brought the wombat so strongly into conflict with the farmer, but to me it was wonderful. It meant that you were dealing with a real other; that contact had to be on his terms and not just on yours. Discipline, punishment and training to accept human will, of the sort we apply to dogs, were out of the question; not only would they be totally ineffective, but they would jeopardise the entire basis of relationship. Once you had recognised that he would not give way to you, you were motivated to find creative ways to work around conflict or to give way yourself. A corollary of his independence was his anger when thwarted. Birubi tended to get quite angry if shut out of the house or the veggie patch, would snort in a loud disgusted tone and sometimes retaliate destructively, for example by chewing the doormat or digging a big hole in front of the garden gate. As primarily a grass eater, he rarely did much harm in the veggie garden though (except for digging up the carrots). He did not usually hold a grudge for long, although there were a few occasions when he was still angry with me the next day for something I had done the day before. Wombats, being burrow dwellers, like a few home comforts. Birubi liked to sit (and in his latter days especially sleep) right in front of the wood stove in midwinter. He was fascinated by the fire and used to poke his nose right up against the hot glass until it hurt (something he never learnt not to do). He was 51 The Eye of the Crocodile very partial to a hot bum rub, and loved to stand in front of the stove rubbing his rear end against the warm corner. Birubi’s sexual expression began while he was still quite young and only subsided in the last few years of his life. He was erotically aroused by cushions, and would attempt to copulate with them after a fifteen-minute foreplay period of savage biting. He was often absent for considerable periods, especially in the warmer months, and several times I came across him miles away. I speculate that he may have been away visiting wombat lovers. If so I hope he treated them better than he did the cushions. Because wombats are solitary and do not form family groups, I know little of Birubi’s relationships with other wombats, with the exception of his male rival Clancy. Clancy lived about two kilometres away but would often come over for a feed and a fight. He was openly envious of Birubi’s privileges in relation to humans and wanted them for himself (and himself alone). Birubi had to face up to Clancy’s aggression when he was still a juvenile, and was valiant in the face of Clancy’s superior age, size and fighting skills. Nevertheless when I heard the sounds of warfare between Clancy and Birubi (a high pitched, harsh call), I would run out and try to separate the combatants and bring peace and light, but was sometimes unable to prevent the infliction of some nasty wounds, mainly to Birubi. The strife between Birubi and Clancy placed me in a painful conflict between wombat ethical systems and human ones. Should I give my favour to the stronger, as Clancy clearly hoped, or use my superior strength to help and sustain the ‘wombat son’ I was so attached to? I found this a dificult moral dilemma, since Clancy was the indigenous occupant, but in the end resolved it in the same way as most human mothers, trying to honour commitment to protect the one near and dear to me while avoiding injustice towards his enemy. Birubi was wily, wary and tough, but the forest is a dangerous place. Sometimes Birubi’s fear of what lay outside the door was palpable. I could not protect him, and every time he left the house I knew that he might be badly injured or that I might never see him again. So the relationship was painful as well as joyful, just as it is for the many human mothers who are powerless to prevent harm to the children they love. Birubi was in great fear of dogs, the privileged gatekeeper animals who are allowed and even encouraged to terrorise the others, and he would often avoid my company, sometimes for a week or so, if I had been to lunch at the house of someone who owned a dog. (I think if people realised what terror and danger they cause to sensitive wild animals like Birubi and those who care about them they would be much more careful about owning and restraining dogs.) This is an example of the great depth of temporal understanding available to those who possess a well-developed olfactory form of knowledge. 52 4. A wombat wake: In memoriam Birubi Birubi was an intelligent herbivore, a vegetarian, I believe, in the full sense, both through his biological inheritance and through his convictions. As a non-meat-eater myself, I had a rare opportunity to observe his opinions on meat eating when a friend came to stay bringing with them a dog they fed normally on fresh mutton on the bone. I watched Birubi carefully inspecting and snifing the site where the dog ate its flesh meals and examining a partly consumed bone. He gave every sign of horror, and came to the house only infrequently and with the greatest reluctance while the dog and the meat smell remained around.
